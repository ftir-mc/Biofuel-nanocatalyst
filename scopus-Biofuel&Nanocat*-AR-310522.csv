In this context, agricultural residues can be catalytically converted into furan derivatives. Among furan-based compounds, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) are the valuable chemicals that can be converted into desired materials, including fuels. This review article discusses various catalytic HMF and DMF production pathways and the influence of feedstocks, catalysts, solvents, and hydrogen donors on the process yield. Additionally, reaction temperature and H2 pressure effects on the feedstock conversion and HMF and DMF production yields are also presented. The primary attention has been devoted to the literature published in the last five years. However, additional relevant examples have also been discussed to clarify the topic further where necessary. This review aims at providing state-to-the-art information on the current developmental state of DMF and HMF production for researchers in this field. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","2,5-dimethylfuran; 5-hydroxymethylfurfural; Carbohydrates; Catalytic synthesis; Furan; Valuable chemicals","Agricultural wastes; Biofuels; Carbohydrates; Climate change; Energy policy; Feedstocks; Fossil fuels; Organic pollutants; Organic solvents; 2,5-dimethylfuran; 5 hydroxymethyl furfurals; Catalytic pathways; Catalytic synthesis; Energy demands; Energy sector; Future energies; Green energy sources; Sustainable strategies; Valuable chemicals; Aromatic compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129745200

Metal oxide; TiO2 and porous; AlSBA-15 catalysts were synthesized and a composite characterized using XRD, BET, N2 adsorption –desorption studies, TPD and SEM techniques. This work was focussed in the catalytic degradation of low density polyethylene over the synthesized catalysts in a fixed bed reactor. A hydrocarbon rich gasoline range of liquid fuel, coke and gas were the expected products from the experiment. The liquid products were analysed using GC MS equipped with J&amp;W Scientific DB-Petro capillary column (100 m × 0.25 mm × 0.5 m). An optimum yield of liquid fuel was obtained with TiO2 catalyst at 1st h of reaction and further the product yield considerably decreased. A marginal increase in % conversion of low density polyethylene into fuel was observed with increasing catalyst: polymer ratio in the presence of TiO2 catalyst till 1:5 ratio. The liquid products contained lower range of hydrocarbons with higher content of active catalyst; while the samples collected at later stage contained heavier components. Mesoporous AlSBA-15 worked comparatively better than TiO2 by converting 89.7% of LDPE into 54.8% combustible liquid products. The catalytic activity of the catalyst followed the order of TiO2/AlSBA-15 (10%) &lt; AlSBA-15 (27) &lt; SiSBA-15 &lt; TiO2. A considerable increase in gasoline fraction from 45.6% to 85.4%, yield of liquid fuel (89.1%) and conversion (98.4%) was observed during cracking in the presence of TiO2/AlSBA-15 catalyst. Plastic liquid fuel produced over the composite catalyst revealed the calorific value of 47.8 MJ/Kg which was higher than the commercial petroleum fuel. Finally, we obtain this biofuel application as mathematical model to evaluate and plot the interaction energy arising from the conjugation of TiO2 - AlSBA-15 nano-catalyst in two possible configuration, linear (conical) and spherical molecules, along the range of the αdistance (z-axis). © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Combination; Interaction energy; Lennard-Jones Potential; Optimization; Plastic fuel; SBA-15; TiO2; TiO2/ AlSBA-15; Van der Waals force","Aluminum compounds; Biofuels; Catalyst activity; Catalyst supports; Chemical reactors; Gasoline; Liquids; Metals; Nanocatalysts; Paraffins; Polyethylenes; Van der Waals forces; Waste disposal; Combination; Interaction energies; Liquid products; Nano-catalyst; Optimisations; Plastic fuel; SBA-15; TiO2/ AlSBA-15; Van der waals' forces; ]+ catalyst; Titanium dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130146292

Secondary hard templating was applied on the ZSM-5 support by carbonaceous charcoal particles in order to increase the pore size in favour of better diffusion of the large triglyceride molecules. The ultrasound irradiation was also applied with three different powers on impregnation of CaO active phase and its effect on well dispersing the particles was investigated. FESEM images showed high distributed and smaller particles on the surface of highly sonicated catalyst compared to the non-sonicated sample and BET-BJH results confirmed the opening of the pores and therefore size and volume increase by sonication. TPD-CO2 results indicated that both secondary templating and sonication have increased the strong basic sites. The particles were also smaller and less agglomerated due to sonication as observed in TEM images. Catalytic performance tests also confirmed the effective role of secondary charcoal templating on the conversion of oil as well as the positive influence of ultrasound irradiation.

Biomass contains all the substances in nature that in the recent past were living things, made from living organisms or their wastes. Biomass is carbon-based and is a mixture of organic molecules, including hydrogen, usually oxygen, and often nitrogen, and small amounts of other atoms such as alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, and heavy metals. Production and consumption of biomasses grew in sustainable procedures do not cause a net change in the CO2 content of the atmosphere. So, the biomasses can be regarded as carbon neutral due to the mentioned net carbon cycle they involve. Energy production from biomass sources is utilized to generate electricity and heat. These sources are renewable sources and CO2 production of these sources is natural and does not produce greenhouse gases. The development of practical techniques for sustainable energy generation from biomass is one of novel strategy to overcome air pollution and move towards the sustainable bioeconomy. This study reviews recent progress in Biomass-derived nanoelectrocatalysts for the sustainable energy development that includes biomass-based electrocatalyst synthesis, biomass-based nanoelectrocatalysts for water splitting, and biomass-based nanoelectrocatalysts for fuel cells. Finally provides future perspectives to motivate future research such as the necessity to increase agricultural and so food production while reducing inputs to balance biomass valorization for energy production versus biomass upgrading, and to develop practical techniques for cheap pretreatment and metabolic engineering of lignocellulosic and efficient strategies for the commercial-scale production of lignocellulosic based-biofuels. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass; Fuel cell; Nanoelectrocatalysts; Sustainable energy; Valorization, Upgrading","Alkali metals; Alkalinity; Biofuels; Biomass; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Electrocatalysts; Energy conservation; Greenhouse gases; Heavy metals; Metabolic engineering; Sustainable development; Energy productions; Global approaches; Growing demand; Ligno-cellulosics; Low carbon economy; Nanoelectrocatalyst; Recent progress; Sustainable energy development; Valorisation; Valorization, upgrading; Fuel cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129316993

As biohydrogen emits no greenhouse gases and can be generated from a variety of waste biomass or feedstocks, it has been referred to as the most effective and cleanest form of energy among all biofuels. In spite of the success of photobiological and dark fermentation methods in generating biohydrogen, they are known to produce lower yields, creating serious obstacles for commercial production. The role of nanoscience and technology in improving the biohydrogen production is achieved through the use of nanomaterials with specific physiochemical and structural properties. In this review, metals, metal oxides, metal alloys, and inorganic nanomaterials are explored in order to improve biohydrogen production. Initial studies have focused on nano materials evaluation in biomass conversion and addressing the current status of nanomaterials in biohydrogen production. The best bio-H2 yield is obtained in the presence of metal nanoparticles (NPs) such as Ag (2.4 mol H2/ mol glucose), Cu (1.74 mol H2/ mol glucose), Fe (3.10 mol H2/ mol malate), alloys of Al/Cu/Fe (4.2 mol H2/ sucrose) and Ni (2.54 mol H2/glucose).

Owing to their non-polluting characteristics and price-effectiveness in contrast to fossil fuels, biofuels are rapidly gaining attraction as substitute resources of renewable energy. Although BFCs have numerous applications including waste management, biomaterials, and portable purposes, encouraging their use is difficult due to the limited lifetime and reduced power density. The majority of BFCs created to date are only capable of meeting the energy requirements of biomedical short-term implanted devices. To accelerate their development, however, the attention is shifting to the deployment of technology that will enhance their productivity. Nanotechnological approaches appear to be the most promising in this context. Nanotechnologies are one of the most intriguing scientific and technological revolutions in recent history, with applications in biofuels and bioenergy. Nanoparticles are gaining popularity among scientists due to their unique qualities, which allow them to be used in a variety of industries including agriculture, electronic devices, medicines, and food processing. The use of nanoscale materials in the production of BFCs has been extensively researched and reported as a viable technique for enhancing their performance. In this review, insights about BFCs, classification, and beneficial applications of biofuel cells are explored. The purpose of this work is to highlight recent advances in the development of various nanomaterials, such as metallic nanomaterials, magnetic nanomaterials, carbon nanoparticles, etc. for enhancing the efficiency of biofuel cells as well as biofuel production such as biodiesel, biohydrogen, biogas, and bioethanol synthesis, intending to enhance process yields.

The obtained final materials were calcined in air at 800 °C for 3 h referred by TGA analysis denoting as CaO_tr catalyst. All of the catalysts were characterized and tested by using several techniques including XRD, EDX, SEM, basic strength by Hammett indicator method, total basic site by TPD-CO2, and BET specific surface area by N2 adsorption. The results indicated that the CaO_tr had a specific surface area of 7.5544 m2/g and it was higher than CaO_un approximately 2 times. The kinetics of the reaction followed pseudo-first-order with the rates constants of reaction (k) equal 1.35☓10-2 min-1 for the reaction which catalyzed by acid-treated golden apple snail shells-derived CaO catalyst (CaO_tr), while un-treated golden apple snail shells-derived CaO catalyst (CaO_un) gave k value of 1.18☓10-2 min-1, respectively. Under the optimal of reaction conditions at catalyst loading of 5 wt. %, methanol/oil molar ratio of 12:1, reaction temperature 65 °C, and 5% v/v relative to the amount of methanol of THF as a co-solvent; more than 97% yield of biodiesel could be achieved in 150 min by using CaO_tr. The final part, biodiesel product obtained from palm oil and WCO catalyzed by CaO_tr catalyst has high quality and meets the specified standards of biofuels for the diesel engines both of the EN-14214 and ASTM-D6751 standard testing method.

To curtail this issue, attached growth system had been introduced by various studies; however, those were still unable to alleviate the socio-economic challenges faced in commercializing the microalgal biomass production. Thus, this study had developed a novel approach in cultivating-cum-harvesting attached Chlorella vulgaris sp. microalgae, whilst using solid organic waste of palm kernel expeller (PKE) as the supporting and alimentation material for microalgal biofilm formation. The effects of three variables, namely, PKE dosage, light intensity, and photoperiod, were initially modelled and later optimized using Response Surface Methodology tool. The derived statistical models could predict the growth performances of attached microalgal biomass and lipid productivity. The optimum growing condition was attained at PKE dosage of 5.67 g/L, light intensity of 197 μmol/m2 s and photoperiod of 8 light and 16 dark hours/cycle, achieving the microalgal density and lipid content of 9.87 ± 0.05 g/g and 3.39 ± 0.28 g/g, respectively, with lipid productivity of 29.6 mg/L day. This optimum condition had led to the intensification of biodiesel quality with a high percentage of monounsaturated fatty acid, i.e., oleic acid (C18:1), encompassing 81.86% of total fatty acid methyl ester components. Given that the positive acquisition of PKE as an excellent supporting material in enhancing the microalgal density and lipid productivity that had resulted in the commercially viable biodiesel quality, this study served as a novel revolution in augmenting the microalgae and solid waste utilities for sustainable energy generation. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Attached microalgal growth; Biodiesel; Chlorella vulgaris; Lipid; Optimization; Palm kernel expeller","alternative energy; biofilm; biofuel; biomass; fatty acid; growth rate; light intensity; microalga; photoperiod",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129764723

However, the environmental and sustainable issues associated with the burning of fossil fuel have motivated the production of biofuel. Zeolite Y is a well-known solid acid catalyst due to its outstanding properties such as large uniform micropore (0.73 nm), high surface area and intrinsic acidity. Unfortunately, the sole micropore of zeolite Y has imposed diffusional limitation for bulky molecules that lead to low catalytic activity and catalyst deactivation due to pore blockage. In this work, we have adopted two synthesis strategies to solve diffusional limitation of conventional zeolite Y. First, mixing the precursor solution and organosilane template at low temperature (4 °C). Secondly, recrystallization of zeolite gel solution at low hydrothermal temperature (80 °C). With these efforts, a series of hierarchical nanosized zeolite Y were prepared with different amount of dimethyloctadecyl[3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl]ammonium chloride (TPOAC) (molar ratio of 0.5, 1.5, and 2.5) as a template. The amount of TPOAC added has altered the physicochemical properties of zeolites such as porosity and acidity. The best hierarchical nanosized zeolite Y (MY0.15) was prepared with 0.15 M ratio of TPOAC. It is a 300 nm large aggregate made up of 50 nm zeolite nanocrystals. Besides that, it exhibits a uniform mesopore of 5.8 nm and an acidity of 1.73 mmol/g with a B/L ratio of 0.24. The deoxygenation performance of synthesized zeolites was evaluated through deoxygenation of triolein under H2-free condition at 380 °C for 2 h. The nanosized zeolite Y (MY0) showed a triolein conversion of 47.3% and hydrocarbon selectivity of 60.3%. The presence of uniform mesopore in MY0.15 has improved the conversion and hydrocarbon selectivity to 61.1% and 68.5%, respectively. In terms of initial rate, MY0.15 was 1.7 times faster than that of MY0. In addition, the MY0.15 showed good reusability by retaining 88% of its initial activity after four consecutive runs. Therefore, uniform hierarchical nanosized zeolite Y appears to be an effective catalyst in producing hydrocarbon-like biofuel via H2-free condition and other reactions involving bulky reactants. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Biofuel; Deoxygenation; Hierarchical nanosized zeolite Y; Mesoporous; Organosilane","Biofuels; Catalyst activity; Chlorine compounds; Fossil fuels; Microporosity; Molar ratio; Physicochemical properties; Temperature; Zeolites; Ammonium chloride; Deoxygenations; Hierarchical nanosized zeolite Y; Mesoporous; Micropores; Nanosized zeolites; Organosilanes; Triolein; Uniform mesopores; Zeolite-Y; Hydrocarbons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129327781

They incorporate bio-catalysts composed of microorganisms and enzymes. BFCs are considered among the novel technologies for the production of potable water/electricity and self-powered biosensors simultaneously. However, BFCs, still suffer from various drawbacks, namely, the short lifetime, difficulty in optimizing the optimum operating conditions (substrate concentration and pH), and designing electrodes of sufficient surface area, hence, leading to low power densities and reduced columbic efficiencies. The utilization of nanomaterials in the bioelectrode construction of BFCs has been proposed and demonstrated promising improvement in performance, including electron transfer, thermal and mechanical stability, and conversion efficiency. The use of nanomaterials in bio-electrodes provided large active surface areas between enzymes/electrodes, thus, improving electron kinetics. Carbon-based nanostructures in particular, i.e., carbon-based nanomaterials such as graphene/fullerenes/carbon nanotubes (CNTs)/carbon nanofibers (CNFs), conducting polymers/composites, and metallic nanoparticles/oxides have been extensively investigated. These studies highlighted the progress made in the use of nanomaterials/enzymatic immobilizations for improving the performances of electrodes. Challenges and opportunities related to the stability and durability of BFCs for long-term applications have been discussed for future development directions.

The characteristics of bioethanol make it an ideal fuel additive due to its eco-friendliness and calorific value. Fermentation technology is used to convert carbohydrate-rich biomass into biofuel, but technical glitches and high costs have been identified as drawbacks. Nanomaterials have contributed significantly to bioethanol synthesis in terms of enhanced surface activity and selectivity. By using nanoparticles, various steps in the production of bio-alcohol can be made more efficient and cheaper. Based on the extensive review carried out, the best bioethanol yield reported were: dolomite at 121 °C (106%), methyl-functionalized cobalt ferrite– silica at 37 °C (126.9%) and calcium alginate at 37 °C (100%). Magnetic iron oxide covered cellulase yielded 60% in the temperature range of 24–96 °C and Silica-immobilized cellulase yielded 32 g/L at 25–60 °C.

However, the production of recalcitrant is inevitable when OFMSW is pretreated at high temperatures and alkali dosage. This study develops a strategy to use Fe3+ to reduce the formation of recalcitrant compounds, i.e., 5-HydroxyMethyl Furfural (5-HMF), furfurals, and humic acids (HA) during thermal-alkali pre-treatment. It was postulated that the formation of the recalcitrant compound during pre-treatment can be reduced by Fe3+ dosing to oxidize intermediates of Maillard reactions. A decrease in 5-HMF (45–49%) and furfurals (54–66%) was observed during Fe3+ (optimum dose: 10 mg/L) mediated thermal-alkali pre-treatment owing to the Lewis acid behavior of FeCl3. The Fe3+ mediated assays show a substantial improvement in VS removal (28%) and biogas yield, i.e., 31% (292 mL/gVSadded) in 150 °C + 3 g/L NaOH, 34% (316 mL/gVSadded) in 175 °C + 3 g/L NaOH, and 36% (205 mL/gVSadded) in 200 °C + 3 g/L NaOH assays, over their respective controls (no Fe3+ dosing). The reducing property of Fe3+ rendered a low ORP (−345 mV) in the system than control, which is beneficial to the anaerobic microbiome. Electrical conductivity (EC) also shows a three-fold increase in Fe3+ mediated assays over control, promoting direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) amongst microbes involved in the electrical syntrophy. The score plot and loading plots from principal component analysis (PCA) showed that the results obtained by supplementing 10 mg/L Fe3+ at 150, 175, and 200 °C were significantly different. The correlation of the operational parameters was also mutually correlated.

Compared with Ni nanoparticles on H-Y, La addition shows a significantly enhanced stability and performance in the continuous liquid-phase hydrogenation of γ-valerolactone (GVL) into ethyl pentanoate (EP) at 200 °C for 1000 h. Complementary characterization studies reveal that La addition in the metal/zeolite catalyst not only efficiently modulates the acid property of the zeolite to alleviate coke formation, but also suppresses zeolite dealumination and metal agglomeration and leaching upon catalysis over a 1000 h period.

To effectively tackle the fossil fuels dilemma, biofuels can encounter current energy demands by re-proposing existing biomass as feedstocks for biotransformation into various energy forms, such as bioethanol, biohydrogen. Because current methods cannot fully exploit the potential, the concept of using nanomaterials to accelerate the process was developed. Nanoparticles have a lot of potential for producing biofuels in a sustainable and commercially viable way. In the dark- and photo-fermentative organisms feed sugars and biowaste materials, the potential function of nanoparticles in enhancing bioethanol and biohydrogen generation has been investigated. The ability to use nano-supports in different subfields for biocatalysts might be a significant strategy for achieving the economic feasibility of several processes that are now being investigated, with minimal or no interference from nanosized particles in catalytic activity. Furthermore, nanocatalysts can be employed in different areas to chemically catalyze cellulose depolymerization or oil and fat transesterification with great efficiency. While there are hazards associated with every new technology, and the world is now far better positioned to analyze those risks and respond appropriately, it appears that the application of nanotechnology to biofuels may be advanced without harming security, public health, or the environment. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Bioethanol; Biofuel; Biohydrogen; Nanocatalysts; Nanoparticles","Bioethanol; Catalyst activity; Ethanol; Fossil fuels; Health hazards; Health risks; Hydrogen production; Image enhancement; Nanocatalysts; Public health; 'current; Bio-hydrogen; Biowastes; Current energy; Energy demands; Energy forms; Irreversible damage; Nano-catalyst; Potential function; Renewables; Nanoparticles; Biomass; Damage; Energy; Ethanol; Fossil Fuels; Oil; Photographs; Processes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125463893

In this work, experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to investigate the effect of benzylic alcohol (α-hydroxyl group, CαH─OH) dehydration to α,β-alkenyl group (Cα = Cβ) on the enhancement of the β-aryl ether (β-O-4) bond cleavage reactivity of lignin model dimer over Pd/C by formic acid. This study demonstrated that the β-O-4 bond cleavage reactivity was significantly enhanced via the benzylic alcohol dehydration to Cα = Cβ. The cleavage reactivity of the β-O-4 bond attached to Cα functional groups was in the order of α-hydrogen atom (CαH─H) &gt; CαH─OH &gt; α-carbonyl group (Cα = O). An easy formation of the CαH─H from the Cα = Cβ hydrogenation led to the enhancement of the β-O-4 bond cleavage reactivity being achieved. The β-O-4 bond cleavage rate was increased by 6.2 times in the presence of the CαH─H compared to the Cα = O. Due to few and lower required energy barriers after CαH─OH dehydration, the β-O-4 bond attached to the Cα = Cβ was more thermodynamically favorable to be cleaved.

Recycling rates for PW are still low, so solutions to the problem of waste accumulation are urgently needed. We report the transformation of waste polyethylene terephthalate food containers into plastic waste char (PWC) via anaerobic pyrolysis and subsequent conversion to an acidic solid catalyst for conversion of palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) into biodiesel. Such an approach could provide a promising solution to the environmental issue of PW while simultaneously facilitating production of biofuels. In this study, PW was carbonized at 600 °C to yield a carbon precursor that was subsequently treated with sulfuric acid at three sulfonation ratios (1:10, 1:15 and 1:20) to give a series of solid acid sulfonated carbon catalysts, PWC-SO₃H (a), (b) and (c). The synthesized PWC-SO₃H catalysts were thermally stable up to 375 °C. The deposition of sulfonic acid groups onto the catalytic surface was confirmed by infrared spectroscopy. Surface morphology analysis revealed a mesoporous textural structure with random sulfonate group distribution. Changes in crystallinity for PWC and PWC-SO₃H catalysts were determined by x-ray diffraction spectroscopy and supported by Raman analysis. The catalysts were then evaluated for biodiesel production efficacy via esterification of PFAD with methanol. The PWC-SO₃H (b) catalyst (1:15 impregnation ratio) provided the highest yield of PFAD-derived-biodiesel (96.9%) under the optimum reaction conditions of 5 wt% catalyst at 110 °C for 2 h with a methanol to PFAD molar ratio of 18:1. Recyclability studies revealed that the PWC-SO₃H (b) catalyst was reusable for four consecutive reactions while maintaining high catalytic activity. Lastly, the fuel properties of the resulting PFAD biodiesel were within the limits prescribed in ASTM D6751, the American biodiesel standard. © 2022 The Institution of Chemical Engineers","Biodiesel; Esterification; Fatty acid methyl esters; Heterogenous catalyst; Palm fatty acid distillate: Plastic waste; Pyrolysis","Carbon; Catalyst activity; Crystallinity; Esterification; Esters; Fatty acids; Infrared spectroscopy; Methanol; Molar ratio; Morphology; Plastic bottles; Plastic recycling; Polyethylene terephthalates; Pyrolysis; Surface morphology; Carbon catalysts; Fatty acids methyl esters; Fuel properties; Heterogenous catalysts; Palm fatty acid distillate; Palm fatty acid distillate: plastic waste; Plastics waste; Synthesised; Waste characterization; ]+ catalyst; Biodiesel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130115655

Biodiesel is a green fuel produced by transesterification of triglycerides with an alcohol in the presence of a catalyst. The current study entails modelling and simulation of biodiesel production, through an acid transesterification process, using both classic and intensified methods, coupled with an environmental impact analysis performed following the Life Cycle Assessment methodology. The traditional biodiesel production consists in the synthesis and separation sections, while the intensified method is based on reactive distillation. ChemCAD software was used to simulate and evaluate the processes from a technical point of view. Methanol is generated using CO2 and H2, this method being considered as a new approach for CO2 utilization. Water electrolysis is employed for H2 generation, with either biomass or natural gas as power source. A cradle-to-gate environmental analysis is performed within the current research by means of GaBi software, considering the following system boundaries: i) upstream processes: catalyst supply chain, sunflower oil supply chain, natural gas supply chain, limestone extraction and decomposition, ii) main-processes: methanol and biodiesel production, iii) downstream processes: disposal of wastes. ReCiPe method was chosen as the impact assessment method. High purities for the main product and by-product are obtained (i.e., purities higher than 99%). The outcome of the process simulation points to the conclusion that the intensified path gives better performances from technical point of view. The environmental results show that the classic approach performs better when CO2 and H2 are used as raw materials, while reactive distillation displays a higher efficiency when natural gas is used as feedstock. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiesel production; Life cycle assessment; Methanol production; Process modelling and simulation; Reactive distillation","Binary alloys; Biodiesel; Carbon dioxide; Catalysts; Climate change; Distillation; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Gallium alloys; Lime; Methanol; Natural gas; Supply chains; Transesterification; Waste disposal; 'current; Biodiesel production; Climate change mitigation; Methanol production; Process modeling and simulations; Reactive distillations; Sustainable fuels; Sustainable technology; Transportation sector; ]+ catalyst; Life cycle; alcohol; biofuel; byproduct; catalyst; climate change; distillation; electrokinesis; environmental impact; life cycle analysis; methanol; methodology; modeling; natural gas; oil supply; simulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129563821

In this regard the use of heterogeneous catalyst for producing biodiesel is classified as a new promising technology as of its characterization for saving in the production total cost. Heterogeneous transesterification reaction is applied to change the waste cooking oil WCO triglycerides to methyl esters with applying lower concentration of alcohol, while the yielded biodiesel has fitted the ASTM norms. In the current investigation, the maximum biodiesel yield obtained was 95% at optimal reaction conditions of 60 min reaction time, 60 °C reaction temperature, 0.01 mass% TiO2 nano-catalyst, 0.3 mass% NaoH, and 1:10 V/V% oil to methanol percentage. Also, the influence of diesel, biodiesel blend, and Cadmium (II)-Based supramolecular coordination polymer nano-additives, {[Cd (EIN)2(SCN)2]}, SCP 1, on the performance and emissions of DI diesel engine were studied experimentally by varying the engine load at 1400 rpm. While the obtained results show a great reduction in UHC, CO, and NOx emissions with increasing the SCP 1 nanomaterials. However, the CO2 emissions show a unique increase in its value by adding SCP 1 as a nanoparticle. If 70 ppm of SCP 1 is used the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) has reached 31.2% as associated with the tested fuels. Also, temperature of the engine exhaust (EGT) was analyzed for all tested fuels, where a consequent reduction was observed. © 2021, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","Biodiesel; CI engine; Combustion; Emission; Heterogeneous catalyst; Nanoparticles; Waste cooking oil","Biodiesel; Cadmium compounds; Diesel engines; Nanocatalysts; Nanoparticles; Oils and fats; Oxide minerals; Supramolecular chemistry; Titanium dioxide; Brake thermal efficiency; Heterogeneous catalyst; Heterogeneous transesterification; Nanoparticle technologies; Optimal reaction condition; Performance and emissions; Research organization; Supramolecular coordination polymers; Fuel additives",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108783339

Coatings on the wood are used to preserve it from degradation by physical, chemical, and biological attacks, and this attribute is considered as a barrier property. Latter due to commercialization, the non-permeability to volatile substances and gases is also considered as a part of barrier property. Renewable and biodegradable cellulose derivatives and lignin have been known for their porosity, hydrophilicity, and barrier property. Hemicellulose and lignin are not preferred much when compared to cellulose for many commercial applications. However, the onset of nanotechnology has made utilization of these waste or non-treatable by-products of lignocellulosic biomass as potential barrier coatings in the food and paper industry. Moreover, the weakening process of lignocellulosic biomass by microbial enzymes or microbes conjointly with nanoparticles decreases the barrier property which could be utilized for biofuel applications. Nanomaterial conjugated hemicellulose has exhibited the lowest oxygen and vapor permeability level of 0.1799 cm3·μm/m2·d·kPa and 2.75 × 10−11 g/m·s respectively, whereas lignin seems to have long term moisture control for up to 189%.

Thus, this work aimed to apply the electrolytic paste (SB) of spent AA batteries as a catalyst. The SB was heat-treated (400 and 800 °C) and characterized by FTIR, XRF, XRD, TGA, SEM-EDX, titratable acidity, and soluble alkalinity. Although the thermal treatment changed the constituent phases, a majority presence of manganese and zinc was observed in the materials. The extracted tucumã almond oil was also characterized, showing a high percentage of saturated fatty acids (75%) and high acidity (9.25 KOH/g oil). The untreated SB showed higher acidity (0.02 mmol/g) and, consequently, higher catalytic activity in transesterification reactions, resulting in good conversions (>97%). Temperature and reaction time were the most significant parameters, according to ANOVA. SB also showed high catalytic activity in the esterification of oleic acid, achieving good conversions (96%). Thus, the electrolytic paste proved to be a potentially efficient and eco-friendly catalyst for biodiesel production, even from highly acidic oils. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiesel; Esterification; Spent battery; Transesterification; Tucumã almond oil","Catalyst activity; Electric batteries; Esterification; Esters; Potassium hydroxide; Saturated fatty acids; Transesterification; Almond oil; Biodiesel production; Electrolytics; Environmental problems; FTIR; Spent batteries; Transesterifications; Tucumum almond oil; XRD; ]+ catalyst; Biodiesel; acidity; biofuel; catalyst; chemical reaction; electrokinesis; oil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129443314

The biggest obstacle to use biodiesel as a fuel is its high price. Using waste feedstock, cheap catalysts, and advanced production techniques can decrease the biodiesel price to be reasonable. This research can be divided into a technical part and an economic part. The technical one investigates biodiesel production from used cooking oil (UCO) and heterogeneous natural minerals rocks (NMR) catalyst via two different techniques conventional and ultrasonic. The technical study reveals that the ultrasonic technique has many advantages over the conventional one, as it does not need any feedstock pretreatment steps (one-step reaction), and uses a lower catalyst loading, methanol, and reaction time to produce the same biodiesel yield of about 99%. The second part relates to an economic study performed on a biodiesel plant with a capacity of 150 thousand tons per year based on the optimum operating conditions obtained from the technical part. The economic assessment proves that biodiesel production using NMR and UCO is very profitable, and the ultrasonic process achieves a higher net profit than the conventional one. The economic study concludes that the cost of the biodiesel that is produced via the ultrasonic method is 0.63 $/L and via the conventional method is 0.72 $/L, and both values are below the biodiesel selling price (0.78 $/L). © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiesel; Conventional transesterification; Natural minerals rocks; Techno-economic assessment; Ultrasonic transesterification; Used cooking oil","Biodiesel; Catalysts; Feedstocks; Minerals; Oils and fats; Profitability; Ultrasonic testing; Biodiesel production; Conventional transesterification; Natural mineral rock; Natural minerals; Techno-economic assessment; Transesterifications; Ultrasonic techniques; Ultrasonic transesterification; Used cooking oil; Transesterification; assessment method; biofuel; catalyst; chemical reaction; mineral resource; technical efficiency; ultrasonics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128185819

This work focused on the comparison of the products obtained from microwave pyrolysis (MP) and conventional pyrolysis (CP). Methods: The experimental work was carried out using MP and CP at 500 °C and 800 °C. The properties of biochars produced from these reactions were characterized. The biofuels were characterized using FTIR and GC-MS, while the biogas was measured using GC-TCD. The composition of the H2 gas or syngas was also analyzed. Significant Findings: MP improved the yield of bio-oil and biochar, but the percentage of biogas yield decreased. The yield of bio-oil produced from the MP of RH and EFB pellets reacted at 800 °C increased significantly from 12.2 to 20.6 wt.% and 15.5 to 20.2 wt.%, respectively. The bio-oil derived from MP has a high content of monoaromatics and phenolic compounds compared to the oil produced from CP. Meanwhile, the bio-oil derived from CP contained a significant amount of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Although the yield of biogas produced via MP was slightly lower than CP, the total syngas produced from MP was significantly high for both EFB (78 vol.%) and RH (70 vol.%). For CP, only 62 vol.% and 68 vol.% of syngas was produced using EFB and RH, respectively. The findings highlight the potential of MP technology to synthesize environmentally-friendly bio-oil and biogas with a high percentage of syngas. © 2022 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers","Biofuel; Biogas; Conventional pyrolysis; Microwave pyrolysis; Oil palm empty fruit bunch; Rice husk","Biofuels; Fruits; Palm oil; Pelletizing; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Pyrolysis; Synthesis gas; Bio-oils; Biochar; Comparative assessment; Conventional pyrolyse; Empty fruit bunches; Microwave pyrolysis; Oil palm; Oil palm empty fruit bunch; Rice husk; Syn gas; Biogas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126684751

NiCo/MCM-41-H pretreated by H2 exhibits superior catalytic performance (65.8 wt% biofuel yield and 98.2% C12-C18 alkanes selectivity) on converting jatropha oil than that by NH3 and by CH4/H2. For comparison, the NiCo/MCM-41-H shows the smallest NiCo alloy grains, the smallest amount of strong acid, the lowest Brønsted acid/Lewis acid ratio, and the most uniform dispersion of Ni and Co. All the distinct surface properties of NiCo/MCM-41-H reasonably account for high efficiency in hydrodeoxygenation of jatropha oil. The work reveals the relationship between NiCo bimetallic catalyst structure and its hydrodeoxygenation performance, and provides a robust pretreatment method for tuning the surface properties to improve its catalytic performance for converting biomass oils into green biofuel. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Catalytic hydrodeoxygenation properties; Jatropha oil; NiCo/MCM-41 catalyst; Pretreatment atmosphere","Binary alloys; Biofuels; Catalysts; Cobalt alloys; Dispersions; Particle size; Surface properties; Bimetallic catalysts; Catalytic hydrodeoxygenation property; Catalytic performance; Hydrodeoxygenation; Jatropha oil; Nico/MCM-41 catalyst; Pre-treatments; Pretreatment atmosphere; Property; ]+ catalyst; Ammonia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122799042

This study explores the potential of using blended feedstock consisting of inedible jatropha oil (JO) and waste cooking oil (WO) for biodiesel production. Prior to blending, the unfavourable high acid value of jatropha oil was esterified under the most optimal conditions of 60 °C, 1% H2SO4 catalyst and alcohol to oil molar ratio of 11:1 to maximise the esterified yield (81.1 %). Based on the acid value measurement, the optimum volumetric blend of WO/EJO was determined to be 90/10 with the lowest acid value of 1.9 mg KOH g−1, which was then utilised as feedstock for base-catalysed transesterification. The KOH catalysed transesterification was optimised at 60 °C, 1 wt% KOH catalyst and alcohol to oil molar ratio of 6:1 to produce biodiesel with low acid value (0.2 mg KOH g−1), high calorific value (38.4 MJ kg−1), high oxidation stability (∼11 h) and favourable viscosity (4.7 mm2 s−1). The results show that the produced biodiesel has acceptable physicochemical properties but its properties can further be improved by blending with petroleum diesel and antioxidant. Among those produced blend derivatives, petroleum diesel and biodiesel blend (80:20) or B20 showed the best improvement with high calorific value (46.6 MJ/kg), high oxidation stability (∼37 h) and low acid value (0.3 mg KOH g−1). Based on the study, in situ feedstock blending of WO/EJO can improve the physicochemical properties of the produced biodiesel and reduce the dependency on single feedstock. Biodiesel blending with commercial diesel can enhance the biodiesel fuel properties and such derivatives can be directly applied in an existing engine. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Alternative energy; Antioxidants; Biodiesel blending; Biofuel; Environmental sustainability; Waste management","Antioxidants; Blending; Catalysis; Catalysts; Diesel engines; Esters; Fatty acids; Feedstocks; Molar ratio; Physicochemical properties; Potassium hydroxide; Sustainable development; Transesterification; Acid value; Alternative energy; Biodiesel blending; Biodiesel production; Environmental sustainability; Fuel properties; Jatropha oil; Lower acids; Molar ratio; Waste cooking oil; Biodiesel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122622027

In this study, six novel, nonedible seed oil producing feedstock were explored for their potential for sustainable production of biodiesel. It is very important to correctly identify oil yielding plant species. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used as reliable tool for authentic identification of oil yielding seeds. Macromorphological characters of seeds were studied with light microscopy (LM). Outcomes of LM of seeds exposed distinctive variation in seed size from 16.3 to 3.2 mm in length and 12.4 to 0.9 mm in width, shape varied from oval to triangular, and color from black to light brown. Oil content of nonedible seed ranged from 25 to 30% (w/w). Free fatty acid content of seed oil varied from 0.32 to 2.5 mg KOH/g. Moreover, ultra structural study of seeds via SEM showed variation in surface sculpturing, cell arrangement, cell shape, periclinal wall shape, margins, protuberances, and anticlinal wall shape. Surface sculpturing varied from rugged, reticulate, varrucose, papillate, and striate. Periclinal wall arrangements confirmed variation from rough, wavy, raised, depressed, smooth, and elevated whereas, anticlinal walls pattern showed variation from profuse undulating, smooth, raised, grooved, deep, curved, and depressed. It was concluded that SEM could be a latent and advanced technique in unveiling hidden micromorphological characters of nonedible oil yielding seeds which delivers valuable information to researchers and indigenous people for precise and authentic identification and recognition. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","biodiesel; identification; micromorphology; nonedible oil yielding seeds; scanning electron microscopy","biofuel; vegetable oil; anatomy and histology; human; plant seed; scanning electron microscopy; Biofuels; Humans; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Plant Oils; Seeds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121374994

Environmental concerns, such as the greenhouse gas (GHG) effect caused by a wide variety of reasons, including the excessive use of fossil fuels, have forced the hunt for green energy and biofuel possibilities. Humanity is looking for cleaner fuels to satisfy energy requirements and preserve the world for future generations. Biofuels must be produced in huge quantities, although efficient alternatives do not meet with the current technologies. Catalyst nanoparticles can make the existing technologies more selective, productive, and can improve quality. Biofuel's feedstock is available and can significantly cut fossil fuel usage with improved processing. In this perspective, we focused on production of biofuels using various feedstocks, such as pyrolysis, directed mixing, micro-emulsion, transesterification (biodiesel manufacturing techniques), and hydrolysis, acidic genesis, acetogenesis, methanogenesis (biogas fabrication techniques), and pyrolysis. Nevertheless, the production of biofuels poses certain notable hurdles. Raw material costs and the option for the use of convenient innovation for effective biofuel production are talked about repeatedly, as is the accessibility of commercially attractive nanoparticles and the organic comprehension of the nanomaterial and protein system, and the suitability of enzymes and nanomaterials to microorganisms. Therefore, nanoparticle-based biofuel production has huge inherent potential, and a lot more study needs to be done to address the technological restrictions of liquid biofuels production. © 2021","Bio-oil; Biodiesel; Bioethanol; Biofuels; Biogas; Biohydrogen; Nanocatalysts; Nanomaterials","Biodiesel; Bioethanol; Biogas; Emulsification; Ethanol; Feedstocks; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Manufacture; Nanocatalysts; Nanoparticles; Pyrolysis; Sustainable development; Bio-hydrogen; Bio-oils; Biofuel production; Energy requirements; Environmental concerns; Environmental damage; Gas effects; Green energy; Greenhouses gas; Nano-catalyst; Nanostructured materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121103186

Oleaginous yeasts have demonstrated multiple advantages over algae and bacteria such as high lipid yields, lipid similarity to vegetable oil, and requirement of lesser area for cultivation. Oleaginous yeasts grown on lignocellulosic solid waste as renewable feedstocks have been widely reported and reviewed. Recently, industrial effluents and other liquid wastes have been evaluated as feedstocks for biodiesel production from oleaginous yeasts. The idea of the utilization of wastewater for the growth of oleaginous yeasts for simultaneous wastewater treatment and lipid production is gaining attention among researchers. However, the detailed knowledge on the economic aspects of different process involved during the conversion of oleaginous yeast into lipids hinders its large-scale application. Therefore, this review aims to provide an overview of yeast-derived biodiesel production by utilizing industrial effluents and other liquid wastes as feedstocks. Various technologies for biomass harvesting, lipid extraction and the economic aspects specifically focused on yeast biodiesel production were also analyzed and reported in this review.

Here, we report on selective transformation of furfural either to FA or 2-MF achieved over zeolite BEA-supported Rh catalysts by optimizing Si/Al ratio and charge-balancing cations of the support. Among studied H- and Na-exchanged aluminosilicate BEA zeolite supports (Si/Al = 12.5; 25; 68; 150), Rh@Na-BEA catalysts lacking Brønsted and strong Lewis acidity showed enhanced selectivity towards FA (75 – 94% depending on the Si/Al ratio) at 74 – 84% conversion of furfural. In turn, selective formation of 2-MF (98% selectivity at 87% conversion) was observed over Al-rich Rh@H-BEA catalyst (Si/Al=12.5) with the highest concentration of Brønsted acid sites. Weaker adsorption of FA on Na- vs. H-form of Rh@BEA-12.5 catalyst was verified by FTIR spectroscopy and is assumed a key factor governing selective hydrogenation of furfural to FA over Rh@Na-BEA catalysts. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","2-methylfuran; Charge-balancing cations; Furfural; Furfuryl alcohol; Rh@BEA","Aldehydes; Catalyst activity; Catalyst selectivity; Catalyst supports; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Hydrogenation; Ion exchange; Positive ions; Selective catalytic reduction; Silicon; Sodium compounds; Zeolites; 2-methylfuran; Charge-balancing cations; Furfuryl alcohol; Microenvironments; Platform molecules; Rh@BEA; Selective reduction; Si/Al ratio; Value-added chemicals; ]+ catalyst; Furfural",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116286335

In particular, the homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic deoxygenation methods have been the center of attention during recent years. Although catalytic deoxygenation of fatty acids via heterogeneous catalysis has been widely investigated, there is a high demand to review the progress in using the homogeneous catalysis pathways. Among the various homogeneous pathways, radical-based reactions and transition metal catalysis demonstrate the most promising results in the decarboxylation and decarbonylation processes. It is shown that radical-based reactions are more active in decarboxylation meanwhile the transition metal catalysts are rather selective to decarbonylation of fatty acids. Besides, the reaction conditions and type of catalysts are capable of enhancing biofuel production.

This work shows the conceptual design of a process for the production of GVL from levulinic acid by means of catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) over a bifunctional Zr-Al-Beta catalyst using an excess of isopropyl alcohol (IPA) acting as the hydrogen donor and solvent. The process is advantageously conducted in the liquid phase under moderate conditions, avoiding the use of high-pressure hydrogen. A techno-economic analysis of the process is presented, considering a production scale of 368.9 kg/h of GVL (ca. 85.5% GVL mass yield from levulinic acid). Such an analysis considers two main process sections, namely, (i) the reaction unit and (ii) the downstream purification section designed to achieve 99 wt % GVL purity together with 95% recovery of unreacted IPA. The analysis provides an investment of 6.4 MM€ with 7.5 MM€ annual operational costs (74% corresponding to reactants). The Minimum Selling Price for GVL is estimated to be 3076 €/ton. Finally, cost sensitivity analyses revealed the high IPA purchasing price and losses in side reactions (autoetherification) as the main obstacles to obtain a GVL competitive market price through this approach. © 2022 The Authors.

However, biofuels originating from lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) are extremely challenging because of their low carbon content, low stability, and high oxygen content. This work evaluates the supercritical methanol (scMeOH) co-liquefaction of rice straw and linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) at temperature range of 240–340 °C for 0–2 h, to obtain hydrocarbons (HCs)-rich oil and carbon-rich solid product. Results show that reaction temperature dominated the yield and properties of products, but not the holding time. Among parameters tested, 30.07 wt% oil yield with 75.79% HCs content and 33.05 wt% oil yield with 70.91% HCs content were obtained at 300 °C for 1 h and 1.5 h, respectively. Simultaneously, the remaining solid products were still as high as 53.85 wt% with a carbon content of 79.59% and 48.28 wt% with carbon content of 81.34% under 300 °C for 1 h and 1.5 h, respectively.

Taking into account the pollution problems associated with fossil fuels, biomass resources come as a promising alternative energy source. The biomass to biofuel conversion can be achieved through strategies such as thermochemical (gasification and direct liquefaction) or biological processes. Moreover, catalytic approaches are increasingly used for biofuel production. In this context, the role of nanocatalysts becomes crucial when considering product quality and optimal operating conditions. Novel nanocatalysts with advanced properties can reduce the most common problems encountered in heterogeneous catalysts: unproductiveness, resistance to mass transfer, time-intensive, rapid deactivation. Consequently, the development of new types of nanocatalysts registered a rising trend. This work focuses on biofuels and tackles a series of aspects such as classification, production technologies, and strategies for yield increase in the context nanocatalysts use.

There are many reasons why biofuels are viewed by both developed and industrialized countries as important technologies. These include reasons related to energy supply, climate, foreign exchange savings, and rural socio-economic issues. The term modern biomass is generally used to describe the traditional use of biomass through effective and clean fuel technologies and a long-term provision of biomass resources as well as environmental and competitive fuel, heating, and power using state-of-the-art conversion technologies. For electricity and heat generation, modern biomass can be used. The most recent biomass-backed transportation fuel is bioethanol and biodiesel as well as diesel generated by synthesis from biomass Fischer–Tropsch. The petroleum additive/substitute is bioethanol. Wood, paint, and even household waste can be processed into bio-ethanol economically. The organic ethanol comes from alcoholic fermentation by hydrolysis process of the saccharides or simple sugars provided by biomass. Starch, sugar or oil-generating crops are currently the basis for the production of transport fuel. The use of vegetable oils for the production of biodiesel has been renewed because of less pollutant and sustainable nature than traditional petroleum diesel. The role of catalysts in biofuel production is highly praised as the rate of conversion and reusability are the major concerns of production economics. Biodiesel is a petroleum-based diesel renewable alternative. Bio-oil production is enabled by biomass energy conversion facilities. In the biomass thermal conversion processes, pyrolysis is the most critical method. A brief overview of the basic concepts involved in biomass fuel thermochemical conversion is reviewed with a major focus on the use of nanotechnologies for biofuel production. High potential heterogeneous nanocatalysts (zinc oxide, silver oxide, doped nanoparticles, alloy nanoparticles, titanium dioxide, magnesium dioxide, iron oxide, and others), as well as their synthesis and characterization have been considered with much emphasis on green production strategies. The share of biomass in the renewable energy sector is around 62%.

With the combination of detail catalyst characterizations, catalytic performance of the Zr-LigS catalyst, in-situ ATR-FTIR and poisoning experiments, the hydrothermal treatment of Zr4+ and LigS resulted in the formation of basic sites, which contributed significantly to the CTH reaction. Kinetic experiments demonstrated that the activation energy was as low as 41.9 kJ/mol.

The hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of anisole specifically represents a model reaction for the conversion of lignin to biofuels through the removal of the aromatic carbon-oxygen bonds. To date, a range of Ni-based catalysts have been reported as highly active systems for the HDO of anisole. However, there has been a substantial lack of consideration given to the environmental characteristics of these catalytic systems, in contrast with the scope of the sustainable production of biofuels. Herein, Ni-based SiO2 catalysts are prepared by a solventless and highly efficient mechanochemistry approach, having a considerably lower environmental impact as compared to standard impregnation methods. Importantly, scrap catalytic converters (SCATs) are employed as co-catalysts, proving the possibility of enhancing the catalytic HDO of anisole, with a scarcely exploited waste material. The results demonstrate that the combined use of Ni/SiO2 as catalysts and Ni/SCATs as co-catalysts remarkably boosts the rate of the conversion of anisole up to more than 50% by achieving an almost complete conversion of anisole in only 40 min instead of at 200 °C and 4 MPa H2. © 2022 The Authors.

In this work, acid-base bi-functional Co doped Fe2O3–CaO nanocatalysts were prepared by one-pot hydrothermal followed by calcination method for biodiesel production from soybean oil and waste frying oil (WFO). The catalyst was characterized by XRD, XPS, TPD technologies and so on. The results showed that the doping of Co into the Fe2O3 lattice makes α-Fe2O3 crystal transform into γ-Fe2O3 thus the catalyst has stronger magnetic strength for magnetic separation. And the catalyst preparation conditions and reaction parameters were optimized, the results showed that under the 16:1 methanol to oil molar ratio, 3 wt% catalyst dosage, and 70 °C for 150 min, the enhanced catalytic activity and improved FFA resistance with the 98.2% and 91.5% biodiesel yield from soybean oil and WFO can be obtained, respectively. In addition, stability and reusability of the catalysts were improved and no distinct activity drop after 5 consecutive transesterification recycles. Furthermore, the functional group and composition of biodiesel were analyzed using GC-MS, ATR-FTIR and NMR techniques. And combustion dynamic characteristics were analyzed by TG, and the results demonstrate that the produced biodiesel has good combustion ability and potential application in industrial production. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Acid-base bi-functional nanocatalyst; Biodiesel; FFA resistance And reusability; Transesterification; Waste frying oil","Biodiesel; Catalyst activity; Cobalt; Computer software reusability; Doping (additives); Hematite; Magnetic separation; Molar ratio; Nanocatalysts; Recycling; Soybean oil; Synthetic fuels; Transesterification; Acid base; Acid-base bi-functional nanocatalyst; Bi-functional; Biodiesel production; Co-doped; FFA resistance and reusability; Nano-catalyst; Transesterifications; Waste frying oil; ]+ catalyst; Reusability; alternative energy; biofuel; catalyst; nanomaterial; vegetable oil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126127673

University St., Peoria, IL  61604, United States","Biodiesel is a renewable biobased fuel obtained from transesterification of plant seed oil with methanol. This fuel has physical properties that make it attractive as an alternative fuel for compression-ignition (diesel) engines. In the United States (US), there is a need to increase the production of sustainable and environmentally friendly biofuels, including biodiesel, to supplement fossil fuels. To meet these challenges, emphasis is being placed on expanding the use of low-cost non-food oils as feedstocks for biodiesel. Low-erucic acid pennycress (LEAP) was developed from field pennycress as a cover crop for use in the Upper Midwestern US. The objective of the present study was to convert LEAP oil to biodiesel (fatty acid methyl esters [FAME]) and evaluate its fuel properties. The same process was applied to FAME made from natural field pennycress (FPC) oil as a baseline for comparison of results. The LEAP oil-FAME (LEAP-ME) had a kinematic viscosity at 40 °C (KV40) that was lower than that of FPC oil-FAME (FPC-ME), and nearly equivalent to the KV40 of soybean oil-FAME (SME). The total saturated-FAME (SFAME) concentration of LEAP-ME (5.40 mass%) was greater than that of FPC-ME. Since SFAME have high melting points, this caused LEAP-ME to have a higher cloud point (CP) than FPC-ME. However, the CP of LEAP-ME (−6.8 °C) was lower than those of canola oil-FAME (CaME; −2.5 °C) and SME (−2.8 °C). The oxidative induction period at 110 °C (IP110) of LEAP-ME was poor (0.83 h), indicating that it would need to be treated with antioxidants before distribution as an alternative diesel fuel. © 2022","Cloud point; Fatty acid methyl esters; Field pennycress oil; Oxidative stability; Predictive models; Viscosity","Biodiesel; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Esters; Fossil fuels; Seed; Soybean oil; Unsaturated fatty acids; Biobased fuels; Cloud points; Erucic acid; Fatty acids methyl esters; Field pennycress oil; Fuel properties; Oil fatty acids; Oxidative stability; Predictive models; Transesterifications; Viscosity; alternative fuel; biofuel; canola; chemical compound; cover crop; fossil fuel; soybean; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123053207

The fossil fuel shortage has been deteriorating over the past few years, because of the rapid increase in population. Many attempts have been made to increase the quality of biofuel with additives. In this paper, two types of nanoparticles such as carbon nanotubes (CNT) and alumina (Al2O3) in chlorella microalgae biofuel were analyzed by experimental method. The added CNT and alumina act as a catalyst that induces complete combustion with retarded emissions. In addition to above, the noise and vibration qualities are also measured. A series of test conducted using single cylinders, four stroke, naturally aspirated compression ignition diesel engine was run by using pure diesel and also different fuel blends ‘such as B10CNT50A50 Chlorella (Microalgae Biodiesel 10% + Diesel 90% + CNT 50 ppm), B20CNT50A50 (Microalgae Biodiesel 20% + Diesel 80% + CNT 50 ppm + Al2O3 50 ppm) and B30CNT50A50 (Microalgae Biodiesel 30% + Diesel 70% + CNT 50 ppm + Al2O3 50 ppm). At a constant load condition, all experimental tests were conducted at four different speeds such as 1500 rpm, 2000 rpm, 2500 rpm and 3000 rpm. The reference fuel of diesel B0 results was compared with blended fuel. From the results, it has been found that the nano additives of CNT and alumina reduced the greenhouse gas emissions of CO compared to plain diesel. Only considering the blended fuel, as the percentage of biofuel increases, the emission of nitric oxide and carbon dioxide is decreased with significant reduction in the amount of noise and vibration and also the combustion and performance qualities were also improved. The highest benefit in terms of all factors was achieved in the fuel blend of B30A50CNT50 amongst the other blends. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiesel; Chlorella vulgaris; Emission; Microalgae; Nanoparticles","biofuel; carbon monoxide; carbon nanotube; gasoline; acoustics; Chlorella vulgaris; exhaust gas; microalga; pollution; vibration; Acoustics; Biofuels; Carbon Monoxide; Chlorella vulgaris; Environmental Pollution; Gasoline; Microalgae; Nanotubes, Carbon; Vehicle Emissions; Vibration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122632693

Yet, such sensors are not established in daily practice, mainly due to their limited selectivity, sensitivity and stability. Catalytic filters offer an effective solution to improve these by converting interferants to inactive species and/or target analytes to more responsive ones. This has been exploited successfully for alkane sensors, enabling their commercial utilization. Here, catalytic filters are discussed as promising tool to optimize the performance of chemoresistive MOx sensors. First, we provide an overview of chemical and physical parameters that govern the catalytic reactivity of such filters and we compare their implementation as overlayers and packed beds. Thereby, recent advances in the nanoscale design of suitable materials to finely tune their catalytic properties are elaborated. Next, filter solutions for analytes of various chemical families (including alkanes, alkenes, inorganics, alcohols, ketones and aromatics) are discussed and quantitatively compared also to other state-of-the-art detectors. Emphasis is placed on present challenging scenarios, for instance, the distinction of analytes from significantly higher concentrated interferants (e.g., breath markers in the presence of background ethanol in hospitals) or chemically similar compounds (e.g., benzene from xylene and toluene in air quality assessment). This is followed by examples demonstrating the integration of such filter-sensor concepts into devices and their evaluation under real conditions.

Petroleum ether (PE) and dichloromethane (DCM) solvent fractions were found to have high lipids and further utilized for biodiesel production, wherein four different heterogeneous nanocatalysts (TiO2, Bio-Fe, GO, and MgO) and commercial homogeneous catalysts (HCl and NaOH) were employed for the transesterification. High fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) recovery (92.3%) was achieved from TiO2 mediated transesterification than the other conventional catalysts. Further, the conversion of algal biomass into bio-oil and by-products was carried out using hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). Subsequently, the compounds were characterized by FT-IR and GC-MS analysis. The quality parameters of liquid biofuels were examined and they are in accordance with the international fuel standards.

Biodiesel is an efficient and renewable substitute for diesel engine. This work investigates the potential of inexpensive nonedible seed oil of Linum usitatissimum to synthesize biodiesel using iron sulfate green nanocatalyst through the process of transesterification. Flax seed contains about 37.5% oil content estimated through Soxhlet apparatus. Light microscopy revealed that seed size varies from 3.0 to 6.0 cm in length, 2.0 to 3.3 cm in width, and 0.7 to 1.0 mm in diameter. Color of seed varied from yellow to brown. Characterization of biodiesel is performed through GC–MS and FTIR. Scanning electron microscopy was carried out to study the morphological features of seed coat. Catalyst was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, energy diffraction X-ray, and X-ray diffraction. The diffraction peaks of Fe3O4 green nanoparticles were found to be in 2θ values, 30.24°, 35.62°, 38.26°, 49.56°, 57.12°, and 62.78°. Fuel properties of biodiesel are also determined and compared with ASTM standards. Linum usitatissimum biodiesel has density 0.8722 (15°C kg/L), kinetic viscosity 5.45 (40°C cSt), flash point (90°C), pour point (−13°C), cloud point (−9°C), sulfur (0.0432% wt), and total acid number (0.245 mg KOH/g). It is concluded that L. usitatissimum seed oil is a highly potential source for biodiesel production to cope with the challenge of present energy demand. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","biodiesel; green nanocatalyst; identification; oil seeds; scanning electron microscopy","biofuel; vegetable oil; esterification; flax; scanning electron microscopy; Biofuels; Esterification; Flax; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Plant Oils",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120711303

The formulated fuels, viz. CeO2 nanoparticles-dispersed water–diesel–biodiesel fuel blend (CNWEDB) and water–diesel–biodiesel fuel blend (WEDB), were prepared using emulsification technique using CeO2 nanoparticles and water as additives in diesel–biodiesel blend (B20). The measured fuel properties of CNWEDB and WEDB satisfied the criteria of Indian Standard for biodiesel indicating their suitability for use in CI engine. The engine was run at various loads (0, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100%) randomly to assess its thermal and environmental performance with all test fuels. Thermal performance of CI engine was evaluated by measuring the parameters such as brake thermal efficiency (BTE), brake-specific fuel consumption (bsfc), exhaust gas temperature (EGT) and heat balance for all test fuels. The environmental performance of engine was assessed by measuring CO, HC and NOx emissions for all test fuels. Adding water and CeO2 nanoparticles into B20 improved BTE of engine by 7.65% over diesel. Also, the minimum heat losses were observed at 80% engine load for CNWEDB indicating a better conversion of fuel energy to useful work. EGT and bsfc of engine reduced with CNWEDB over WEDB and B20 fuels. Engine fueling with CNWEDB emitted 12.82%, 14.46% and 14.20%; and 30.77%, 43.67% and 26.80% lesser concentration of CO, HC and NOx emissions over WEDB and diesel, respectively.

Yet, the reported GOR catalysts suffer low activity (current induced by catalysts toward 1 mM glucose in a 1 cm-2electrode, μA mM-1cm-2), slow response, and poor response to trace glucose. Herein, we fabricate noble-metal-free WO3-decorated carbon nanotubes with strong W-C bonds (WO3/CNT60) (CNT, carbon nanotube). In the GOR, WO3/CNT60 triggers an activity as high as 1960 μA mM-1cm-2, a response time of only 3 s, and a response minimum of only 5 μM and exhibits outstanding stability, anti-interference ability to impurities, and reusability. The GOR performance of WO3/CNT60 is much better than the WO3/CNT catalyst without W-C bonds (1320 μA mM-1cm-2, 10 s, 40 μM) and the widely used noble-metal catalyst (270 μA mM-1cm-2, 10 s, 25 μM). The strong W-C bonds create more C-W-O-W bridge sites active for catalyzing the GOR, thus enhancing the GOR performance of WO3/CNT60. These results open a new way for fabricating a noble-metal-free high-efficiency biofuel cell and sophisticated device to precisely detect trace amounts of glucose and are also helpful for detecting and converting complex molecules like polyols and poly(carboxylic acid)s. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

In this context, development of advanced approaches to produce low-cost commercial cellulase is highly demanding. Therefore, in the present study, simultaneous effect of pomegranate waste (PW) and graphene oxide (GO) has been studied to improve the cellulase production along with improved stability towards the incubation temperature and different pH environment. Crude cellulase production has been achieved at high substrate concentration of PW using co-culturing of strains Cladosporium cladosporioides NS2 and Rhizopus oryzae NS5 under the solid-state fermentation (SSF) while using GO as the nanocatalyst. At a substrate concentration of 7.0 g of PW, highest enzymatic activity of 42 IU/gds FP, 271 IU/gds EG and 422 IU/gds BGL have been achieved by mean of 1.5% GO after 72 h. In addition, crude enzyme exhibits 45–55 °C and 3.5–6.5 as the most favorable incubation temperature and pH range, respectively in presence of 1.5% GO. This study reports a potential strategy to improve the production of crude enzyme along with enhanced thermal and pH stability with the implementation of GO as a nanocatalyst. Thus, the present approach offers a sustainable way to produce crude enzyme that can have numerous industrial applications along with economic biomass to biofuels production technology by providing easy, as well as high yield of sugar production via enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulosic biomass. Nevertheless, recycling of GO when employed as catalyst during the entire process remains to be challenging, and therefore efforts should made to overcome this issue. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cellulase; Graphene oxide; Nanocatalyst; Value addition; Waste biomass","Biomass; Costs; Enzymatic hydrolysis; Fermentation; Nanocatalysts; pH effects; Substrates; Sustainable development; Biofuel production; Cellulase; Cellulase production; Condition; Crude enzymes; Incubation temperatures; Nano-catalyst; Production cost; Value addition; Waste biomass; Graphene",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122822018

This paper examines the effect of addition of nanoparticles in biofuel on diesel engines. The biofuel used for conducting tests was canola oil. Corn oil was mixed with titanium dioxide (TiO2) at different proportions as 25 ppm, 50 ppm, 75 ppm and 100 ppm. These nanoparticles mixed with biofuel and diesel. The nanoparticles were dispersed with biodiesel at the concentration of B10T25 (10% cornoil + 90% diesel + TiO225), B10T50, B10T75, B10T100, B20T25, B20T50, B20T75, and B20T100 and plain biodiesel are B10 and B20. All tests were carried at different speeds 1800 rpm, 2000 rpm, 2200 rpm, 2400 rpm, 2600 rpm and 2800 rpm. Performance and emission characteristics were estimated for all fuel blends. Results were compared to each other to characterize the fuel blend quality. The addition of titania with biofuel increased the performance qualities such as brake thermal efficiency (BTE), exhaust gas temperature (EGT), Torque and Power.

This necessity has been a direct result of the environmental changes that are caused by the usage of fossil fuels. In this regard, sugar cane, corn and soybeans have been employed to make the first-generation biofuels. Second-generation biofuels, made from lignocellulosic crops and forest leftovers, require a lot of land that could have otherwise been utilized for food processing and productions. In this scenario, going by the technical forecasts, microalgae can potentially serve as the primary source for the third-generation of biofuels. By virtue of possessing no such limitations, microalgae are currently viewed as an effective alternative to first- and second-generation biofuels. The goal of this review is to highlight the most effective opportunities for biofuels production using algal sources. In doing so, this review also explains how the chemical compositions of micro and macroalgae, as well as the associated bioactive compounds, render positive influence on biofuel production. In addition to the present review critical discussions have been done on: (a) various growing strategies for rapid cultivation of micro and macroalgae for biomass development, (b) how algal-based ingredients and bioactive compounds are yet unexploited for bioenergy generation, and (c) why algal source and their biomass are regarded as possible bioenergy sources for future green and sustainable energy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Algal biomass; Bioenergy; Biorefinery; Feedstock; Macro algae; Micro algae; Next generation biofuels","Biofuels; Biomass; Cultivation; Environmental impact; Feedstocks; Fossil fuels; Microorganisms; Sugar cane; Algal biomass; Bio-energy; Biofuel production; Biorefineries; Macro algae; Macro-algae; Micro-algae; Microalga; Next generation biofuel; Second generation; Algae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121261424

Biofuels appear to be an ideal sustainable solution that could help meet future energy supply demands while also contributing to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. However, the most significant hurdle in the effective production and utilization of biofuels is the formation of inhibitory compounds such as aliphatic acids, phenolic substances, ketones, alcohols and furan derivatives during the pretreatment and conversion procedure, which results in lower cell density, prolonged microbial lag time and hinders the effective production of biofuels. To address these challenges, nanomaterials are primarily utilized in biofuels production, which enhances the performance of bioprocesses used during the biomass conversion to biofuel by efficiently suppressing the inhibitory compounds formed during the conversion procedure, thus resulting in enhanced biofuel yield. This review is intended to give a brief about the several recent advances made in the utilization of various kind of nanomaterials for suppressing the inhibitory compounds of biofuel production such as bioethanol, biohydrogen and biodiesel under specific conditions. Furthermore, the role of nano-immobilized biocatalysts in suppressing inhibitory compounds has been addressed, with an emphasis on the safety issues and limitations associated with the utilization of nanomaterials in the current approach. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Bioethanol; Biofuel; Inhibitory compounds; Nano-immobilized; Nanomaterial","Bioconversion; Energy utilization; Ethanol; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Ketones; Nanostructured materials; Biofuel production; Conversion procedures; Domestic energy consumption; Global population; Industrial energy consumption; Inhibitory compounds; Nano-immobilized; Oil and gas; Sustainable technology; Technology-based; Bioethanol",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121245040

Energy production from carbohydrate materials has recently been of great interest due to the availability, reliability, and abundance of carbohydrate sources. Significantly, the catalytic transformation of waste carbohydrates into furan-based biofuels, specifically 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF), appears to be an attractive solution to the aforementioned energy and environmental issues. The potential of DMF as a renewable fuel is prospective, with its physicochemical properties that are similar to those of fossil fuels. Therefore, the current work focuses on the production of DMF, with the important aspects for enhanced DMF yield being summarized herein. Notably, the significant catalysts derived from zeolite, noble-metal, non-noble-metal, metal-organic framework, and electrocatalytic materials are discussed, alongside their effects in deriving carbohydrates to DMF. Furthermore, the mechanisms of DMF production were clarified too, followed by the scrutinization of the effects from reaction conditions, solvents, and hydrogen donors onto the DMF yield. Finally, the purification process, commercialization potential, and economic feasibility of DMF production were incorporated too, with insightful future directions being identified at the end of our review. This review is expected to advocate DMF production from carbohydrate materials, which could alleviate the energy and environmental problems encountered presently. © 2022 The Authors.

Pt65Sn35/MWCNTs, without OxOx, showed good electrochemical activity toward EG oxidation and all the byproducts. Pt65Sn35/MWCNTs cleaved the glyoxilic acid C-C bond, producing CO2 and formic acid, which was further oxidized at the electrode. Concerning EG oxidation, the catalytic activity of the hybrid system (Pt65Sn35/MWCNTs+OxOx) was twice the catalytic activity of Pt65Sn35/MWCNTs. Long-term electrolysis revealed that Pt65Sn35/MWCNTs+OxOx was much more active for EG oxidation than Pt65Sn35/MWCNTs: the charge increased by 65%. The chromatographic results proved that Pt65Sn35/MWCNTs+OxOx collected all of the 10 electrons per molecule of the fuel and was able to catalyze EG oxidation to CO2 due to the associative oxidation between the metallic nanoparticles and the enzymatic pathway. Overall, Pt65Sn35/MWCNTs+OxOx proved to be a promising system to enhance the development of enzymatic biofuel cells for further application in the bioelectrochemistry field. © 2022 American Chemical Society.","Enzymatic biofuel cell; Ethylene glycol; hybrid catalyst; Oxalate oxidase; PtSn nanocatalyst",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130197690

To reach this goal, the molybdenum and zirconium oxides were incorporated into commercial available KIT-6, mesoporous silica nanoparticle, by a solvothermal method, to form MoO3/ZrO2/KIT-6 catalyst. The targeted solid composite catalysts were structurally characterized using XRD, TEM, SEM, XPS, EDS, TG, and nitrogen porosimetry measurement. The characterization results showed that the ordered porous structure of the support was well persevered with high surface area, and the molybdenum and zirconium oxides could be highly dispersed on the mesoporous support. The acidic nature of the solid catalyst was evaluated in detail by means of NH3-TPD and infrared spectra of adsorbed pyridine techniques. It was indicated that the acidities of the solid catalysts, with both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, could greatly affected their catalytic activity. This catalyst displayed high activities to the transesterification of triglycerides and esterification of free fatty acids (FFAs) simultaneously owing to the synergistic effect of Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, thus achieving one-pot heterogeneous production of biodiesel as the low-quality oil was used as feedstocks. The influence of reaction parameters and the catalyst reusability were also investigated, and the best oil conversion of 92.7% was obtained under the optimized reaction conditions. The targeted catalyst exhibited a better FFAs and water tolerant for the reaction, advantageously with no noticeable decline in the catalytic performance even after five reaction cycles. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiesel; Heterogeneous catalyst; KIT-6; Molybdenum; Transesterification; Zirconium","Ammonia; Catalyst activity; Catalyst supports; Environmental protection; Fatty acids; Mesoporous materials; Molybdenum oxide; Reusability; Silica nanoparticles; Sustainable development; Transesterification; Zirconium compounds; Biodiesel production; Composite catalysts; Heterogeneous catalyst; KIT-6; Lewis acid site; Low qualities; One pot; Solid catalysts; Transesterifications; ]+ catalyst; Biodiesel; biofuel; catalyst; composite; molybdenum; oil; oxide; silica; simulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124234283

Instead of discarding leftover cooking oil as waste, recent technological advancements have made it possible to use WCO as a sustainable feedstock for biofuels production, while also addressing the disposal issue. This work developed an efficient and high stability hydrothermal WCO transformation process into green diesel fuel. In the present work, a homemade environmentally benign activated carbon was prepared from a bio-sourced precursor and impregnated with a Pd precursor. A set of experiments were conducted at 300 °C–350 °C, 40 and 50 bar, and times up to 240 min to evaluate the performance of Pd/AC catalysts against deoxygenation (DO) and deactivation reactions. The results showed a substantial enhancement of the activity and stability of the coated Pd/AC catalyst versus the uncoated one. Also, the green diesel fuel possesses an outstanding higher heating value of 46 kJ/mol. Based on experiments, the best kinetic model for the DO process was developed. The optimum kinetic parameters were obtained by the optimization approach.

The crops and fruits produced by such means should be utilized completely; however, there are still losses and under-exploitation of these produces which has resulted in wastes being mounted in landfills. These underutilized agricultural wastes including vegetables and fruits can serve as a potential source for biofuels and green diesel. This paper discusses the main routes (e.g., biological and thermochemical) for producing biofuels such as bioethanol, biodiesel, biogas, bio-oil and green diesel from underutilized crops by emphasizing recent technological innovations for improving biofuels and green diesel yields. The future prospects of a successful production of biofuels and green diesel by this source are also explained.

Several analytical tools (EDX, FT-IR, SEM and XRD) were used to characterise the Ag2O nanocatalyst. Maximum (89%) FAME yield of the PBSOB (Prunus bokhariensis seed oil biodiesel) was achieved at ambient transesterification conditions i.e. 3.5 wt% nanocatalyst loading, 2.5 h reaction time, 130 °C of reaction temperature and 12:1 alcohol to oil ratio. The synthesised PBSOB was additionally characterised by analytical methods like, GC-MS and FT-IR. The different aspects of fuel were identified i.e. flash point (84 °C), kinematic viscosity (4.01 cSt @ 40 °C), sulphur content (0.0003 wt %), density (0.853 kg/L) and acid number (0.167 mg KOH/g). All the above properties were verified and agreed well with biodiesel international standards (European Union (14214), China GB/T (20828) and ASTM (6751, 951).

The catalyst was synthesized from clay and calcined using calcium oxide under controlled conditions. Clay is a natural soil material containing a large amount of amorphous silica. After processing calcium oxide and heating under controlled conditions at 800 °C, high surface area silica with amorphous structure was produced. The amorphous structure of the synthesized catalyst was confirmed by XRD analysis. The results of SEM analysis indicated that the particles had a spherical structure, distributed evenly and uniformly. The effect of five parameters of reaction temperature, catalyst concentration, oil to methanol volume ratio, toluene concentration, and reaction time on the purity of the biodiesel was evaluated through utilizing the response surface methodology (RSM).

Currently, the development of efficient catalysts which can effectively cleavage C–O bond under mild conditions remains a critical challenge. The present work reports Pt catalysts supported on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNT) which are active in 2-methylfuran (2-MF) hydrogenolysis to form pentanols in liquid phase under mild conditions. The impact of various catalyst supports, active metals and reaction conditions in terms of metal loadings, solvent, time, pressure, etc., were explored. The 5 wt% Pt/MWNT catalyst demonstrated an excellent activity and selectivity with 100% 2-MF conversion and 53% pentanols (POLs) yield under 1 MPa H2 at an exceptional low temperature of 25 °C. The reaction mechanism was studied combing both the reactivity tests and characterization results, and it is found that the better catalytic performances of Pt/MWNT were correlated closely to the size of Pt nanoparticles and their interactions with the underlying MWNT support. Accordingly, a reaction pathway involving the adsorption of 2-MF parallel to the Pt nanoparticles and its subsequently selective C–O hydrogenolysis was proposed. This work showcases a promising catalyst for room-temperature biofuel production.

CoSi-PS exhibited excellent catalytic performance for the hydrogenolysis reaction of HMF to produce liquid 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) biofuel. 100% conversion of HMF and 97.5% selectivity for DMF were achieved at 170 °C and 1.5 MPa H2 for 4 h, which was superior to most of the reported catalysts.

The life cycle assessment was performed to evaluate the environmental impacts of biodiesel production utilising waste PAS, considering 1000 kg of biodiesel produced as 1 functional unit. The recorded results showed the cumulative abiotic depletion of fossil resources over the entire biodiesel production process as 22,920 MJ, global warming potential as 1150 kg CO2 equivalent, acidification potential as 4.89 kg SO2 equivalent and eutrophication potential as 0.2 kg PO43− equivalent for 1 tonne (1000 kg) of biodiesel produced. Furthermore, the energy ratio (measured as output energy divided by input energy) for the entire production process was 1.97. These results demonstrated that biodiesel obtained from the valorisation of waste PAS provides a suitable alternative to fossil fuels. © 2021","Circular economy; Life cycle assessment; Prunus armeniaca seed oil; SrO-La2O3; Synergistic effect; Waste biomass","biodiesel; carbon; carbon dioxide; ester derivative; fat; fossil fuel; lanthanum oxide; metal oxide; methanol; strontium; strontium oxide; sunflower oil; unclassified drug; vegetable oil; biofuel; biofuel; biomass; catalyst; deciduous tree; life cycle analysis; oil; seed; waste technology; acidification; apricot; Article; biofuel production; biomass; catalysis; catalyst; controlled study; cooking; energy; environmental impact; eutrophication; fossil; greenhouse effect; life cycle assessment; nonhuman; plant seed; reaction time; stoichiometry; synergistic effect; valorization; waste; animal; catalysis; life cycle stage; Animals; Biofuels; Catalysis; Life Cycle Stages; Plant Oils; Prunus armeniaca",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121435641

Inspired by this, tail-gas was utilized to control organic pollutants. Methylene blue (MB), as a model pollutant, was rapidly decolorized by the tail-gas, and oxidative degradation was substantially proven by full-wavelength scanning with a UV–visible spectrometer. The tail-gas from six typical lignocellulosic feedstocks produced 68.0–98.3% MB degradation, suggesting its wide feedstock compatibility. Three other dyes, including rhodamine B, methyl orange and malachite green, obtained 97.5–99.5% degradation; moreover, tetracycline, resorcinol and hexachlorobenzene achieved 73.8–93.7% degradation, suggesting a superior pollutant compatibility. In a cytotoxicity assessment, the survival rate of the degraded MB was 103.5% compared with 80.4% for the untreated MB, implying almost no cytotoxicity after MB degradation. Mechanism investigations indicated that the self-exothermic reaction in PHP pretreatment drove the self-generated peroxy acids into tail-gas. Moreover, it heated the pollutant solution and thermally activated peroxy acids as free radicals for efficient pollutant degradation.

Waste oils are the optimal raw materials to produce biofuels due to their high hydrogen and volatile matter content. However, traditional disposal methods such as gasification, transesterification, hydrotreating, solvent extraction, and membrane technology are difficult to achieve satisfactory effects owing to shortcomings like enormous energy demand, long process time, high operational cost, and hazardous material pollution. The usage of clean and safe pyrolysis technology can break through the current predicament. The bio-oil produced by the conventional pyrolysis of waste oils has a high yield and HHV with great potential to replace fossil fuel, but contains a high acid value of about 120 mg KOH/g. Nevertheless, the application of CaO and NaOH can significantly decrease the acid value of bio-oil to close to zero. Additionally, the addition of coexisting bifunctional catalyst, SBA-15@MgO@Zn in particular, can simultaneously reduce the acid value and positively influence the yield and quality of bio-oil. Moreover, co-pyrolysis with plastic waste can effectively save energy and time, and improve bio-oil yield and quality. Consequently, this paper presents a critical and comprehensive review of the production of biofuels using conventional and advanced pyrolysis of waste oils. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Biofuels; Catalytic co-pyrolysis; Environmental sustainability; Synergistic effects; Waste oils","Biodiesel; Fossil fuels; Sodium hydroxide; Solvent extraction; Sustainable development; Waste incineration; Waste treatment; Acid value; Bio-oils; Catalytic co-pyrolyse; Copyrolysis; Critical review; Environmental sustainability; High grades; Pyrolysis feedstocks; Synergistic effect; Waste oil; Pyrolysis; biofuel; carbon; lignocellulose; metal; oil; unclassified drug; waste oil; zeolite; plastic; biofuel; catalysis; catalyst; combustion; environmental issue; extraction method; fossil fuel; hydrogen; literature review; pyrolysis; volatile organic compound; Article; biofuel production; biomass; catalysis; economic aspect; human; plastic waste; pyrolysis; waste; food; heat; Biofuels; Catalysis; Food; Hot Temperature; Plastics; Pyrolysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117229272

CeO2 was loaded over mesoporous ZnO in different percentages (X = 5, 10, 20, 30 and 50) to reach the optimum acid-base balance, and remove the internal mass transfer resistance. Ultrasonication was adopted as an efficient approach to synthesize the nanocatalysts with modified features. XRD, FESEM, TEM, EDX, BET-BJH, FTIR TPR-H2, and TPD-NH3 characterization analyses were carried out to identify the as-fabricated nanocatalysts. Bi-metallic nanocatalysts were tested in one-pot biodiesel production from a high free fatty acid containing model of waste oil. In each cycle, the conversion of esterification and transesterification reactions, as well as the overall conversion were estimated, and the superior activity was achieved over sonoassisted designed CeO2 = 20% nanocatalyst (FFA conversion = 80%, TG conversion = 97% and total conversion = 93%). According to the results of analyses, this outcome is depended on the uniform dispersion of active components, high SBET, and pore volume, as well as the suitable acid site density and strength. The promotion effect of ultrasonic waves on CeO2 dispersion not only increased the activity of nanocatalysts but also yielded satisfactory stability. Sono-designed sample with CeO2 = 20% exhibited the most stable nanocatalyst that maintained its performance after five cycles. Moreover, CeO2 = 20% showed high performance without deactivation in the presence of NaCl which is one of the impurity elements in waste cooking oil. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Biofuel; CeO2(X%)/ZnO; Properties/Performance Evolution; Sono-Hydrothermal","Ammonia; Biodiesel; Cerium oxide; Dispersion (waves); Fatty acids; Hydrothermal synthesis; II-VI semiconductors; Nanocatalysts; Nanocrystals; Oils and fats; Sodium chloride; Zinc oxide; Catalytic properties; CeO2(X%)/ZnO; Nano-catalyst; Nanocrystallines; Performance; Performance evolutions; Property; Property/performance evolution; Sono-hydrothermal; Waste oil; Mass transfer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116722315

In this work, biodiesel was produced from Prosopis julifera seed oil using ethanol as solvent and magnesium nanocatalyst and the process was optimized by employing an advanced statistical optimization method; definitive screening design. The maximum biodiesel yield from Prosopis julifera seed was found to be 32.5%. Acid esterification and transesterification were applied to minimize the acidity. Acidity of the P. julifera oil was initially reduced to 1.52 mg KOH/g using acid catalyst H2SO4, and then to 0.88mg KOH/g by transesterification process using magnesium oxide. Optimum biodiesel conversion efficiency of 94.83% was achieved under 10:1 ethanol-to-oil ratio, 5% magnesium oxide concentration, 80 min reaction time, 45 °C reaction temperature and 1000 rpm agitation rate. The transesterification reaction was found to be highly affected by the ethanol-to-oil ratio and catalyst concentration. The results showed that the catalytic activity of the magnesium oxide was sufficient for the production of biodiesel from P. julifera seed oil. The fuel properties were evaluated according to ASTM standards. FTIR analysis confirmed the existence of functional groups with respect to the fingerprint region of P. julifera ethyl esters.

How much each country’s economy will be influenced by the production of biodiesel will be determined by the commitment of various stakeholders to the much-needed transition from petroleum-based resources to renewable resources. Biodiesel production is largely determined by the cost of the feedstock (>70%) and this review focuses on the use of waste oil resources as biodiesel feedstock with a special focus on waste cooking oil (WCO). Generating value from waste oil provides an alternative waste management route as well as a positive environmental and economic contribution. The transesterification process for biodiesel production, its catalysis and some important technical and economic aspects are covered in this communication with a special focus on the South African framework. An overview of the current research and its implications going forward is discussed. © 2022 by the authors.

However, their commercial use is limited by their costs and low reusability. Therefore, the scientific and industrial sectors are focusing on finding better strategies to reuse enzymes and improve their performance. In this work, cellulase from Aspergillus niger was immobilised through in situ entrapment and adsorption on bio-inspired silica (BIS) supports. To the best of our knowledge, this green effect strategy has never been applied for cellulase into BIS. In situ entrapment was performed during support synthesis, applying a one-pot approach at mild conditions (room temperature, pH 7, and water solvent), while adsorption was performed after support formation. The loading efficiency was investigated on different immobilisation systems by Bradford assay and FTIR. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was chosen as a control to optimize cellulase loading. The residual activity of cellulase was analysed by the dinitro salicylic acid (DNS) method. Activity of 90% was observed for the entrapped enzyme, while activity of ~55% was observed for the adsorbed enzyme. Moreover, the supported enzyme systems were recycled five times to evaluate their reuse potential. The thermal and pH stability tests suggested that both entrapment and adsorption strategies can increase enzyme activity. The results highlight that the entrapment in BIS is a potentially useful strategy to easily immobilise enzymes, while preserving their stability and recycle potential. © 2022 by the authors.

The waste chalk was modified by CoFe2O4 nanoparticles and K2CO3. The surface tests showed that the obtained catalyst has been successfully synthesized with desired surface properties. The surface areas of waste chalk, waste chalk/CoFe2O4, and waste chalk/CoFe2O4/K2CO3 were determined 20.8, 77.8, and 5.8 m2/g, respectively. This indicates that the waste chalk/CoFe2O4/K2CO3 catalyst has a lower surface area due to K2CO3 being placed on the catalyst. Results showed the efficiency of RSM-CCD (R2 = 0.992) compared to ANN (R2 = 0.974). It was shown that a contact time of 180 min, a temperature of 65 °C, a waste chalk/CoFe2O4/K2CO3 mass of 2 wt%, and methanol to oil mole ratio of 15:1 gave the highest efficiency (98.87%) of biodiesel production at the laboratory conditions. The kinetic results of the process showed the energy of activation and frequency factor of 11.8 kJ/mol and 0.78 min−1, respectively. Also, the values of ΔH°, ΔS°, and ΔG° at 65 °C was calculated to be 9010.7 J/mol, −256.3 J/mol and 95.7 kJ/mol, respectively, indicating that the biodiesel production process is endothermic requiring high energy for proceeding.

Hydrogen peroxide is a potential fuel additive due to extra hydrogen and oxygen content, which improves the combustion process. In this experimental study, biodiesel has been produced from Jatropha oil employing catalyzed transesterification homogeneously to examine its influence on the performance and emissions at engine loads with 1500 rpm utilizing a four-stroke single-cylinder diesel engine. D60B40 (having 60% diesel and 40% biodiesel) and D60B30A10 (60% diesel, 30% biodiesel and 10% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)), are the fuel mixtures in the current study. The addition of H2O2 reduces emissions and enhances the combustion process. This effect occurred due to the micro-explosion of the injected fuel particles (which increases in-cylinder pressure and heat release rate (HRR)). An increase of 20% in BTE and 25% reduction in BSFC for D60B30A10 was observed compared to D60B40. Significant reduction in emissions of HC up to 17.54%, smoke by 24.6% CO2 by 3.53%, and an increase in NOx was noticed when the engine is operated with D60B30A10. The HRR increased up to 18.6%, ID reduced by 10.82%, and in-cylinder pressure increased by 8.5%. Test runs can be minimized as per Taguchi's design of experiments.

A great challenge for this route involves developing efficient non-noble metal catalysts to obtain a high yield of hydrocarbons under relatively mild conditions. Herein, a high-performance catalyst has been prepared via the in situ reduction of Ni phyllosilicate-like nanosheets (Ni-PS) synthesized by a reduction-oxidation strategy at room temperature. The Ni-PS precursors are partly converted into Ni0 nanoparticles by in situ reduction and the rest remain as supports. The Si-containing supports are found to have strong interactions with the nickel species, hindering the aggregation of Ni0 particles and minimizing the Ni0 particle size. The catalyst contains abundant surface defects, weak Lewis acid sites and highly dispersed Ni0 particles. The catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic activity towards the depolymerization and HDO of the lignin model compound, 2-phenylethyl phenyl ether (PPE), and the enzymatic hydrolysis of lignin under mild conditions, with 98.3% cycloalkane yield for the HDO of PPE under 3 MPa H2 pressure at 160 °C and 40.4% hydrocarbon yield for that of lignin under 3 MPa H2 pressure at 240 °C, and its catalytic activity can compete with reported noble metal catalysts. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Catalyst activity; Enzymatic hydrolysis; Hydrocarbons; Lignin; Nanocatalysts; Nickel compounds; Particle size; Precious metals; Surface defects; Condition; High grades; Hydrodeoxygenation; Nickel phyllosilicate; One pot; Phenyl ethers; Phyllosilicate; Renewable energies; Situ reduction; ]+ catalyst; Nanosheets; Enzymolysis; Hydrocarbons; Nickel Compounds; Particle Size; Precious Metals",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124045157

The DUT-5 node-supported cobalt(II) hydride (DUT-5-CoH) is a versatile solid catalyst for chemoselective hydrogenation of a range of nonpolar and polar arenes, including heteroarenes such as pyridines, quinolines, isoquinolines, indoles, and furans to afford cycloalkanes and saturated heterocycles in excellent yields. DUT-5-CoH exhibited excellent functional group tolerance and could be reusable at least five times without decreased activity.

This study investigates the thermokinetics of date seeds (DS) loaded with LDH by thermogravimetric analysis. Three different LDHs, namely Mg-Fe (MF), Ni-Fe (NF), and Co-Fe (CF), were synthesized by the co-precipitation method and loaded with dried date seed powder in a 1:10 ratio, which were then pyrolyzed in-situ in a custom-designed pyrolytic reactor (semi-batch cracking furnace) at an operating temperature and heating rate of 500 °C and 10 °C/min under inert atmosphere (N2). Under optimized operating conditions, the LDH-loaded DS provided a bio-oil yield between 65 and 67 wt%, while the pyrolysis–gas yield was about 20 wt%. The FT-IR analysis of LDH-derived bio-oil confirmed the presence of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons that can be used effectively for energy applications. The pyrolysis kinetics, pyrolysis gas composition, and thermodynamic properties of biomass-loaded with LDH were also investigated. Thermokinetic analysis was performed using data from Coats-Redfern, which fitted the kinetic model at five different reaction mechanisms: chemical reaction order, phase interfacial reaction, power-law, diffusion-controlled, and nucleation and growth models for biomass conversion rates of 20–40% and 40–80%. The results showed that the diffusion-controlled parabolic law (D1) and the fourth-order reaction model (F4) are likely mechanisms in the conversion range of 20–40% and 40–80% for LDH-loaded date seeds. Based on the ascending order of activation energy (Ea), the biomasses can be classified as DS &gt; MF-DS &gt; NF-DS &gt; CF-DS. In addition, the main gasses released and detected from the decomposition of pure biomass (date seeds) and LDH-loaded biomass through a micro GC-Varian were CH4, H2, CO, and CO2. A plausible reaction mechanism for the role of layered double hydroxides in the conversion of bio-oils and pyrolytic-gas components was also presented.

By utilizing efficient labors, smart machines, and minimized energy utilization, the conventional biofuel manufacturing framework can be converted into a smart sustainable manufacturing framework. The existing conventional fuel demand can be replaced by biofuel. This study efforts to make pure biofuel with less amount of carbon emanations and energy utilization through a smart multi-type biofuel manufacturing framework, where the demand of the biofuel is selling price dependent. The different energy costs including air handling cost, lighting cost are calculated in this work-in-process inventory. The carbon emissions cost is included in every stage of this model. A variable demand has introduced for the maximization of profit. To reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions, a two-stage inspection cost with a variable manufacturing rate is taken to make the manufacturing process flexible such that the amount of impure biofuel is minimized. Although a random manufacturing rate is applied through a smart manufacturing system, still impure biofuel is manufactured. The impure biofuel is remanufactured again through refining just after the well-planned manufacturing ends. In this model, the multi-delivery technique is used such that a fixed amount of biofuel of n segments of the pure biofuel is transported to market places at predetermined intervals at the time of delivery frame. The classical optimization technique is used for continuous and differentiable variables and the mixed integer programming technique is utilized for discrete variables to maximize the total profit globally. To validate the model's usefulness, four numerical observations are studied. It is shown that by utilizing the said procedure, the percentage of impure biofuel can be decreased truly through the minimized energy consumption.

In Malaysia, palm-based biomass is being widely studied for the production of transportation fuels due to its abundant supply. Hence, this study focused on the production of bio-jet fuel from different types of palm oil (e.g., palm-based waste cooking oil, palm olein, palm kernel oil) through deoxygenation process. Several types of deoxygenation catalysts (e.g., CaO, Zeolite, V2O5, Pd/C, TiO2) were selected to investigate the efficiency of jet fuel-based hydrocarbon production under condition of 400 °C for 2 h with different catalyst loading (e.g., 0 wt%, 5 wt%, 6 wt%, 7 wt%, 8 wt%, 9 wt% and 10 wt%). The physico-chemical properties of yielded liquid fuel were tested by using GC-MS analyses, as well as density, kinematic viscosity, cloud point, pour point, smoke point, flash point and final boiling point. The deoxygenation of PKO over Pd/C at 8 wt% yielded the highest molar concentration of 96% liquid product (e.g., n-paraffins, isoparaffins, olefins, naphthenes, aromatic) and 73% of jet paraffins selectivity (C8–C16) under 400 °C for 2 h. In addition, the physicochemical properties of palm-based liquid fuel are complied with standard Jet A-1 fuel, in accordance to ASTM standards. The low temperature fluidity, combustion characteristics, and fuel volatility of this liquid product were comparable to Jet A-1 fuel. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Alternative energy; Bio-jet fuel; Combustion characteristics; Renewable jet fuel paraffins; Sustainable aviation fuel; Thermal catalytic cracking","Catalyst selectivity; Chemical analysis; Jet fuel; Liquids; Molar ratio; Palm oil; Physicochemical properties; Smoke; Temperature; TiO2 nanoparticles; Titanium dioxide; Vanadium pentoxide; Zeolites; Alternative energy; Aviation fuel; Bio-jet fuel; Combustion characteristics; Deoxygenations; Liquid products; Physicochemical property; Renewable jet fuel paraffin; Sustainable aviation fuel; Thermal-catalytic crackings; Paraffins; biofuel; biomass; catalysis; catalyst; essential oil; hydrocarbon generation; physicochemical property; Malaysia; Elaeis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115746571

The seed flesh of Krabok was extracted with hexane as a solvent by several techniques to compare the efficiency of each extraction method. The optimal technique for extracting the oil from the Krabok seed flesh was the Soxhlet extraction method which could extract oil content up to 63.58 wt%. The major fatty acid compositions of the obtained Krabok seed flesh oil were lauric acid (C12:0) and myristic acid (C14:0) as around 52 and 35 wt%, respectively. Additionally, the results also found that the extracted Krabok seed flesh oil was obtained greater than 95 wt% of the saturated fatty acid compound. The synthesis of a high-quality biodiesel product from Krabok seed flesh oil was performed via a one-step transesterification process catalyzed by a CaO catalyst. The obtained Krabok seed flesh oil biodiesel product was within both the ASTM-D6751 and EN-14214 standards for liquid bio-auto fuels, and it has properties that were very close to high-speed petroleum diesel oil.

The nanoparticles taken for the research was Al2O3 from metallic nanoparticles group. All the tests were conducted in CI diesel engine at different load conditions such as 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% load. The fuel blends used are B0(Diesel 100%), B15 (15% spirulina biofuel + 85% diesel), B15 (15% spirulina biofuel + 85% diesel- 75 ppm Al2O3), B30 (30% spirulina biofuel + 70% diesel), and B30 (30% spirulina biofuel + 70% diesel- 75 ppm Al2O3) and with all biofuel blends and with pure diesel, 75 ppm Al2O3 nanoparticles were sonicated to estimate the combustion performance and emission characteristics.

Among various studies, a new approach on the usage of low viscous Pimpinella anisum as a green biofuel with waste cooking oil biodiesel blend in the diesel engine efficiently has shed new light in the field of alternative renewable sources of energy. The aim of this work is to eliminate the usage of conventional fuel in a diesel engine by incorporating binary green fuel (Waste Cooking Oil biodiesel blended with Pimpinella anisum as low viscous oil) effectively. The enhancement of Waste Cooking Oil (WCO) biodiesel production was done by employing the transesterification process. Calcium oxide heterogeneous catalyst was prepared using eggshell and it was doped with barium of 4–8 %wt. to improve the catalytic efficiency. Pimpinella anisum oil with its promising properties such as low viscosity, high O2 content, and high boiling point is better suited to the diesel engine and was prepared by steam distillation method. Binary fuels were prepared by blending Pimpinella anisum oil (A) with WCO biodiesel (B) in 90%, 80%, and 70% of volume. The engine was tested with pure diesel and WCO biodiesel for comparative study. The addition of Pimpinella anisum elongated the period of ignition delay. Among the tested fuels, B20A80 has shown better heat release rate (HRR) and cylinder pressure, bringing brake thermal efficiency (BTE) near to that of diesel since the biodiesel operation decreases BTE in diesel engines. It also has shown the reduced formation of soot, Carbon monoxide (CO), and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions by 81.43%, 43.8%, and 18.6% respectively.

To this end, we measure the rates of decarbonylation and hydrogenation of butyraldehyde and the reactive intermediate for the industrially relevant Guerbet condensation and correlate the selectivity and reactivity with the properties of the catalysts via a range of characterization efforts. Data obtained from EXAFS and XANES show that the bulk of the catalyst metallic nanoparticles is enriched in Pd, while the surface is enriched in Cu and Ag. The data for PdxCuy/SiO2 show clear dominance of geometric (ensemble) effects on the selectivity. Conversely, the electronic (ligand) effects of alloying dominate over the reaction rate of the catalysts, as electron donation from Cu to Pd promotes Cu and increases the desired (de)hydrogenation reactions. In contrast, in PdAg catalysts, the weaker electronic exchange, as indicated by Pd LIII XANES and theoretical calculations, is not sufficient to promote Ag, resulting in the monotonic loss of activity with the increasing Ag content and without selectivity improvement. We use the implications of these findings to provide valuable design principles for oxygenate catalysis and to discover a highly selective bifunctional catalyst system, comprising PdCu3/SiO2 and TiO2 for upgrading ethanol to longer-chain oxygenates. © 2022 American Chemical Society.","bimetallic catalysis; decarbonylation; ethanol; Guerbet reaction; hydrogenation; palladium; XANES","Binary alloys; Catalysis; Catalyst selectivity; Copper; Hydrogenation; Palladium; Silicon; Silicon compounds; Titanium dioxide; Bimetallic catalysis; Decarbonylations; Electronic effects; Geometric effects; Guerbet reaction; Pd-Cu catalyst; Pd/Ag catalyst; Reactive intermediate; XANES; ]+ catalyst; Ethanol",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130034115

The conversion of biomass waste into valuable products has received wide attention. In this study, an empty fruit bunch (oil palm EFB) supported magnetic acid catalyst for esterification reaction was successfully prepared via the one-step impregnation process. The new magnetic catalyst achieved a higher surface area of 188.87 m2/g with a total acidity of 2.4 mmol/g and identified iron oxide as γ-Fe2O3. The magnetization value of 24.97 emu/g demonstrated that the superparamagnetic catalyst could be easily recovered and separated after the reaction using an external magnet. The catalytic performance of oil palm EFB supported magnetic acid catalyst was examined by esterification of oleic acid. Esterification process parameters were optimized via Response Surface Methodology (RSM) optimization tool with Box-Behnken design (BBD). The following optimum parameters were determined: an amount of 9 wt% catalyst, molar ratio of methanol to oleic acid of 12:1, reaction time of 2 h and reaction temperature of 60 °C with a maximum conversion of 94.91% was achieved. The catalyst can be recycled up to five cycles with minimal loss in its activity. The oil palm waste-based magnetic acid catalyst indicates its potential replacement to the existing solid catalysts that are economical and environmentally friendly for the esterification process in biofuel applications.

Biodiesel may be made from renewable and sustainable ingredients consisting of vegetable oils and non-poisonous to the ecosystem. The manufacturing of biodiesel with renewable feedstocks and enzymes as catalysts can be supported commercially; however, studies into enhancing performance may be beneficial. Biodiesel gives a sustainable possibility to address the socio-economic and sustainable fuel problems. For competitive biodiesel, massive studies have been focused on growing new and sustainable biodiesel manufacturing technology to enhance productivity. Recently, fourth-generation biofuels (FGBs), genetically modified (GM) algae biomass, have attracted much interest from educational and business communities. However, changing FGBs with mineral assets stays fraught with many demanding situations. In particular, the technical elements of genetic engineering features want to be specified. However, little or no interest has been paid to GM algae biomass. Algal Genetics has a restricted quantity of development views and demanding situations dealing with FGBs. The fourth-generation biofuel concentrates on improving the microorganisms genetically. Although, in the primitive grade, the last two generations of biofuel require genetic change for the more like-suited in yielding a high-quality amount of green diesel. The aim is to define four generations with the most recent developments. This paper consists of the current production strategies of biofuel and the improvement efforts significant for third and fourth generations, mainly a genetic exchange of algae or bacterial strains and co-cultivation of several microorganisms. © 2022","Biodiesel, regeneration; Biofuel, microalgae; Cyanobacteria; Transesterification",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129160777

Climate change has begun showing its impacts on the environment, and the change is real. The devastating COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected lives and the world from the deadly consequences at a social, economic, and environmental level. In order to balance this crisis, there is a need to transition toward green, sustainable forms of living and practices. We need green innovative technologies (GTI) and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to develop green, durable, biodegradable, and eco-friendly products for a sustainable future. GTI encompasses all innovations that contribute to developing significant products, services, or processes that lower environmental harm, impact, and worsening while augmenting natural resource utilization. Sensors are typically used in IoT environmental monitoring applications to aid ecological safety by nursing air or water quality, atmospheric or soil conditions, and even monitoring species’ movements and habitats. The industries and the governments are working together, have come up with solutions—the Green New Deal, carbon pricing, use of bio-based products as biopesticides, in biopharmaceuticals, green building materials, bio-based membrane filters for removing pollutants, bioenergy, biofuels and are essential for the green recovery of world economies.

In this sense, biodiesel is a renewable and alternative biofuel proposal and castor bean and jatropha are interesting non-edible raw materials for its production owing to their high fatty acid content. Transesterification is the most common process applied to industrial-scale biodiesel production owing to its attractive economic characteristics. This process can be catalyzed by chemical (homogeneous or heterogeneous) or biochemical (enzymatic) catalysts. The choice of raw material, as well as the production route of biodiesel, will significantly influence the process parameters. Considering the importance of biodiesel production in Brazil, the present work explores biodiesel production routes focusing on these non-edible raw materials (jatropha and castor bean) and compares them with the process using soy bean, as this is one of the most used worldwide raw materia. In addition, an extensive literature review was performed and the software Microsoft Power BI Desktop was used to model and analyze the selected works, grouping them according to the pattern of each route's influence on process parameters. In addition, the technical scores of each route were determined. The homogeneous chemical route presented better scores and the most interesting parameters for all raw materials; however, considering the technical and environmental advantages related to biochemical and heterogeneous routes, application of environmental impact studies such as life cycle analysis can help decision-making in the search for the most appropriate production route. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","biodiesel; catalytic routes; heterogeneous catalysts; homogeneous catalysts; lipase","Biodiesel; Catalysts; Chemical analysis; Chemical industry; Climate change; Environmental impact; Fatty acids; Life cycle; Transesterification; Biodiesel production; Castor beans; Catalytic route; Heterogeneous catalyst; Homogeneous catalyst; Jatropha; Jatropha oil; Process parameters; Production route; Transesterification process; Decision making",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129083546

All catalysts calcined at 400°C were in the nano-crystallite scale as confirmed by X-ray powder diffraction analysis in the 22.9–28.0 nm range. According to the CO2-temperature-programmed desorption study using thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry techniques, they have a broad spectrum of surface basic sites. Because of the significance of methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) as a next-generation biofuel candidate with high-octane, low boiling point, and relatively high vapor pressure. The prepared catalysts were examined during the direct production of MEK via 2-butanol (2B) dehydrogenation. Among catalysts tested, ZnO promoted with 1% K2O showed a superior catalytic activity towards the conversion of 2B to MEK, that is, 71.7% at a reaction temperature of 275°C. The selectivity for the production of MEK over all catalysts was ≥95% across all catalysts when using N2-gas as a carrier. The use of airflow in this reaction resulted in a clear loss of selectivity toward MEK production as well as the appearance of undesirable products such as acetone and methanol. All catalytic properties of catalysts, particularly those of moderate strength, were highly correlated with the distribution of surface basic sites. Finally, a reaction mechanism was proposed for the dehydrogenation of 2B, followed by the partial oxidation of MEK. © 2022 The Authors.

In this study, a green, environmentally friendly, and low-cost biochar catalyst (PAP-MEPP-C) was prepared by thermochemical treatment of lignin-derived monomers at a low temperature (80 °C), and further developed for high-efficiency production of biodiesel from non-edible Jatropha oil (JO). The characterization results showed that the structure of the PAP-MEPP-C biochar catalyst was layered and 3D structure, and its acidity could be controlled by changing the monomeric composition. The reaction conditions of preparing biodiesel catalyzed by PAP-MEPP-C were optimized by the response surface method, and the obtained maximum biodiesel yield was 97.2%. The kinetics of the (trans)esterification reaction over the developed biochar catalyst PAP-MEPP-C was studied, and its superior catalytic performance to other tested acid catalysts could be supported by a relatively lower activation energy (36 kJ mol−1).

In this regard, the selective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol, 2-methylfuran, and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol has attracted a great interest. This research aims to prepare an active and selective catalyst for hydrogenation of furfural in liquid phase. To achieve this objective, we employed a water-stable zirconium(IV)-based metal–organic framework (MOF) [Zr6O4(OH)4(BTC)2(CH3COO)6] (Zr–BTC) (BTC = benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate) and modified it with Ru and Pd to form Ru/Zr–BTC and Pd/Zr–BTC. The diffractograms of Zr–BTC modified with Ru and Pd metal fit well with the diffractogram of the pristine Zr–BTC, indicating that the presence of Ru and Pd in Zr–BTC does not change the Zr–BTC structure. This is further confirmed by FTIR spectra. The obtained materials showed type I adsorption isotherms, thus the material can be classified as microporous. The presence of Pd/Ru metal on the surface and in the pores of Zr–BTC decreases the total pore volume and BET surface area. Electron microscopy (SEM and TEM) analysis further confirmed that the Pd and Ru were successfully encapsulated in Zr–BTC. Ru/Zr–BTC and Pd/Zr–BTC showed excellent performance in the catalytic liquid-phase hydrogenation reaction of furfural to furfuryl alcohol with conversion of 99.4% and 98.4% for Ru/Zr–BTC and Pd/Zr–BTC, respectively, and selectivity to furfuryl alcohol (FA) up to 100% for both catalysts.

The technology has widely been used to produce H2 and syngas which is subsequently upgraded to obtain valuable biofuels, Fischer–Tropsch chemicals and used in combined heat and power (CHP) plants. Abatement of tar-related complexes with an improved hydrogen content and syngas ratio (H2/CO) via biomass gasification is a critical challenge. In this review, an attempt has been made to evaluate the critical parameters affecting biomass gasification process. It is revealed that each parameter (i.e., biomass feedstock particle size, moisture content, gasifying agent, residence time, equivalence ratio, steam to biomass ratio, and gasification temperature) has significant impact of H2 and syngas production. Fluidized bed gasifiers have been quite efficient for small to medium scale applications to produce optimal syngas ratios. Use of catalyst greatly influenced the H2 and syngas yields. Impregnated catalysts were found to have more pronounced effect on the water–gas shift reaction resulting in improved gas yields. Although, the parametric optimization could be achieved; notwithstanding, economic feasibility and industrial viability are to be considered too. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Biomass; Catalyst; Fluidized bed; Gasification; Syngas",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127718619

The possibility of producing biodiesel from Scenedesmus sp. ASK22 was explored, and the physicochemical parameters of the biodiesel produced were compared to those of Indian petro-diesel. The findings revealed that in an indoor bench-scale culture, the maximal biomass concentration can approach 3.44 g L−1, when compared to the outdoor pilot-scale (2.09 g L−1), using nutrients supplemented simulated dairy effluent (NSDE) as a culture medium. Moreover, as compared to the BG11 medium, the cost of NSDE medium was ~3–4.7-fold lower.

(JC) is a multipurpose species with biological, pharmacological, and industrial applications. Its oil is recognized by the dominant composition of oleic-linoleic fatty acids that make it suitable as biofuel in internal combustion engines, without making major changes to the engine design. Objective. To identify in the oil of five JC genotypes in Colombia the cetane, peroxide, iodine, the acidity value, the calorific value indixes and to verify if they comply with standards for biodiesel production. Materials and methods. An experiment was carried out in Espinal, Colombia, in a randomized complete block design with five treatments and three repetitions. The treatments consisted of five JC genotypes. The fruit from the fifth harvest in 2015 was used. Five fatty acids (oleic, linoleic, linolenic, palmitic, and stearic) and five chemical properties (cetane index, acidity, peroxide, iodine, and calorific value) were determined from the oil. Results. The oil from the five JC genotypes evaluated in Colombia presented a lipid profile with a predominance of monounsaturated (oleic C18: 1) and polyunsaturated (linoleic C18: 2) fatty acids.

Herein, flake-like nanocrystalline molybdenum carbide (α-MoC) is surface-engineered via Pd doping, and the synergy between the in-situ generated Mo vacancies and doped Pd species is shown to promote the selective hydrogenation of naphthalene to decalin. Experimental and theoretical evidence reveal that this enhanced performance is due to the optimization of naphthalene adsorption energy and the establishment of a unique surface structure due to (i) surface environment modulation, (ii) the adjustment of electron density around Mo atoms, and (iii) the change in the strength of Mo-H bonding caused by d-band center optimization. Benefiting from the unique surface structure, the obtained optimum 0.5% Pd-α-MoC catalyst exhibits excellent performance. The developed strategy is successfully used to fabricate other noble metal (Pt, Ru)-doped α-MoC catalysts, thus holding promise as a universal method for the rational design of high-performance metal carbide-based hydrogenation catalysts. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH","Mo vacancies; molybdenum carbide; Pd doping; selective hydrogenation; surface engineering","Biofuels; Catalyst selectivity; Fossil fuels; Hydrogenation; Nanocrystals; Naphthalene; Organic solvents; Palladium; Structural optimization; Decalin; Metal-based catalysts; Mo vacancy; Optimisations; Pd doping; Performance; Selective hydrogenation; Surface engineering; Vacancy generation; ]+ catalyst; Carbides",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126324877

Due to high activity and stability, recyclability, and cost-effectiveness, nanocatalysts are a key area in green chemistry. On the other hand, water as a common by-product or undesired element in a range of nanocatalyzed processes may be promoting the deactivation of catalytic systems. The advancement in the field of hydrophobicity in nanocatalysis could relatively solves these problems and improves the efficiency and recyclability of nanocatalysts. Some recent developments in the synthesis of novel nanocatalysts with tunable hydrophilic-hydrophobic character have been reviewed in this article and followed by highlighting their use in catalyzing several processes such as glycerolysis, Fenton, oxidation, reduction,ketalization, and hydrodesulfurization. Zeolites, carbon materials, modified silicas, surfactant-ligands, and polymers are the basic components in the controlling hydrophobicity of new nanocatalysts. Various characterization methods such as N2 adsorption-desorption, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and contact angle measurement are critical in the understanding of hydrophobicity of materials. Also, in this review, it has been shown that how the hydrophobicity of nanocatalyst is affected by its structure, textural properties, and surface acidity, and discuss the important factors in designing catalysts with high efficiency and recyclability.

The prepared catalyst was recognized using numerous analytical procedures. FTIR spectra inspected the functional groups of the original clay and gave an insight view on the sulfonated clay. XRD provided information on sulfonation of original clay by the shifting of signals at 2θ at 18.5°, 26.55°, and 61.89° peaks to 17.8° (003), 25.5° (003). TPD profile showed the presence of different acidic sites on the surfaces of the studied compounds identified as weak, moderate, and strong types; further, the sulfonation step generated high intensity of the strong acidic sites on the clay surface. Surface area analysis showed that the introduction of sulfonate moieties within the clay framework crowded the pores and decreased their effective area and volume to 66.31 m2/g and 0.11 cm3/g. TGA identification indicated that the introduction of sulfonate groups within the clay framework increased its thermal stability by up to 600°C, due to the hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl groups of clay and sulfonate groups. The analyses pointed out the successful grafting and sulfonation on the clay. The prepared catalyst was employed during catalytic conversion of used cooking oil and Jatropha oil into their corresponding biofuels.

Pyrolysis has received the most attention in the conversion of biomass into fuel. The main disadvantages of chemical and physical properties of pyrolysis crude bio-oil include its high oxygen content and acidity. Catalytic fast pyrolysis can overcome this problem. Rice straw is an abundant biomass residual that can be of environmental negative impact and is not of proper use. Therefore, this research work introduces the use of this residual in the production of fuel sources by one-step catalytic pyrolysis with the reusability of the employed catalyst. A waste extraction catalyst modified with acidic and nickel sites has been prepared and was utilised for the proposed target in this study. The removal of silica, lignin and minerals by treatment of the rice straw with KOH and then HNO3 in a green terminated process improved the catalytic biomass conversion from 83% to 96% at a catalyst dose of 5%, at 250°C. The pre-treatment of the rice straw enables the reusability of the catalyst in direct catalytic pyrolysis where the employed catalyst exhibits good stability in four consecutive runs.

The bio-oil produced by the pyrolysis of the penicillin fermentation residue has the potential to become a biofuel in the future. This paper studied the pyrolysis characteristics of PR at 400°C ∼700°C. According to the weight loss and weight loss rate of PR, the whole process of pyrolysis can be divided into three stages for analysis: dehydration and volatilization, initial pyrolysis, and pyrolytic char formation. The experimental results showed that the yield of the liquid phase is the highest (33.11%) at 600°C. GC-MS analysis results showed that high temperature is beneficial to reduce the generation of oxygenated hydrocarbons (73%∼31%) and the yield of nitrogenous compounds gradually increased (19%∼43%); the yield of hydrocarbons was low in 400°C∼600°C pyrolysis (2%∼5%) but significantly increased around 700°C (22%). In the temperature range of 400°C to 700°C, the proportion of C5-C13 in bio-oil gradually increased (26%-64%), and the proportion of C14-C22 gradually decreased (47%-16%). The catalyst can increase the proportion of hydrocarbons in the bio-oil component.

The obtained hybrids were characterized by various characterization technologies, including Fourier transform infrared, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, N2 physisorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 (NH3-TPD) analysis. The characterization analyses showed that the hybrids have been successfully synthesized. Also, the volume and pore size of UiO-66(Zr) were changed by introducing HSiW@Ce-BDC, and the resulting Ce-BDC@HSiW@UiO-66 possessed the mesoporous structure and relatively high surface area. Simultaneously, the NH3-TPD analysis of Ce-BDC@HSiW@UiO-66 reveals that the acid strength was increased in comparison with HSiW@Ce-BDC. In addition, the composite Ce-BDC@HSiW@UiO-66 demonstrated high catalytic activity, and the oleic acid esterification gave 81.5% conversion at optimum conditions of 0.2 g catalysts, 1:30 oleic acid to methanol molar ratio at 130°C for 4 h. More interestingly, after six recycling cycles, the reduction in the conversion rate was only 4.6%, indicating that Ce-BDC@HSiW@UiO-66 has excellent reusability.

They can be a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels, biofuels, and oleochemicals. Studies concerning efficient oleaginous yeasts isolated from the natural environments remain scarce. Therefore, this study isolated and screened for efficient oleaginous yeasts from the surfaces of longkong fruit (Lansium domesticum) samples in Thailand. Their intracellular SCOs were extracted using an ultrasonic-assisted extraction (UAE) method and quantitatively analyzed. The SCO-accumulating yeasts (produce the amount of SCOs <20 % of their biomass) genetically identified were Candida jaroonii, Meyerozyma caribbica, Kodamaea ohmeri, and Pichia sp., while the oleaginous yeasts (produce the amount of SCOs >20% of their biomass) identified were Pichia manshurica and Hanseniaspora opuntiae. Several isolated yeasts were designated as rare oleaginous microbes. The P. manshurica strain Y2 was considered as the most effective oleaginous yeast with a SCO content of 43.03% (w/w). The fatty acids in the accumulated SCO of this strain were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) that consisted of palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic, and palmitoleic acids. These fatty acids could be further applied in the production of third-generation biodiesel, cocoa butter equivalents, and related high-value oleochemicals. © 2022, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

In general, the production of biodiesel is carried out via transesterification processes of vegetable oil with the presence of a suitable catalyst. A mixed metal oxide has shown to be a very attractive heterogeneous catalyst with a high performance. Most of the mixed metal oxide is made by using the general wetness impregnation method. A simple route to synthesize silane-modified mixed metal oxide (CaO-CuO/C6) catalysts has been successfully developed. A fluorocarbon surfactant and triblock copolymers (EO)106 (PO)70 (EO)106 were used to prevent the crystal agglomeration of carbonate salts (CaCO3-CuCO3) as the precursor to form CaO-CuO with a definite size and morphology. The materials show high potency as a catalyst in the transesterification process to produce biodiesel. The calcined co-precipitation product has a high crystallinity form, as confirmed by the XRD analysis. The synthesized catalyst was characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX). The mechanism of surface modification and the effects of the catalytic activity were also discussed. The biodiesel purity of the final product was analyzed by gas chromatography. The optimum biodiesel yield was 90.17% using the modified mixed metal oxide CaO-CuO/C6. © 2022 by the authors.

Catalytic deoxygenation of the Ceiba oil (high O/C ratio) was conducted to produce hydrocarbon biofuel (high H/C ratio) over NiO-CaO5/SiO2-Al2O3 catalyst with aims of high diesel selectivity and catalyst reusability. In the present study, response surface methodology (RSM) technique with Box-Behnken experimental designs (BBD) was used to evaluate and optimize liquid hydrocarbon yield by considering the following deoxygenation parameters: catalyst loading (1–9 wt. %), reaction temperature (300–380 °C) and reaction time (30–180 min). According to the RSM results, the maximum yield for liquid hydrocarbon n-(C8–C20) was found to be 77% at 340 °C within 105 min and 5 wt. % catalyst loading. In addition, the deoxygenation model showed that the catalyst loading-reaction time interaction has a major impact on the deoxygenation activity. Based on the product analysis, oxygenated species from Ceiba oil were successfully removed in the form of CO2/CO via decarboxylation/decarbonylation (deCOx) pathways. The NiO-CaO5/SiO2-Al2O3 catalyst rendered stable reusability for five consecutive runs with liquid hydrocarbon yield within the range of 66–75% with n-(C15 + C17) selectivity of 64–72%. Despite this, coke deposition was observed after several times of catalyst usage, which is due to the high deoxygenation temperature (&gt; 300 °C) that resulted in unfavourable polymerization side reaction. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","C8-C20 hydrocarbon; Free fatty acid; Mixed metal oxides; Renewable diesel; Response surface methodology; Silica-alumina support",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123501408

In this study, a CoNCx/NiFeO catalyst was synthesized by the adsorption of cobalt (II) phthalocyanine (CoPc) on ultrathin NiFe-layered double hydroxide nanosheets (NiFe-LDH), followed by mild pyrolysis of the resulting CoPc/NiFe-LDH composite at 550 °C under N2 for 5 h. XRD, TEM and XPS showed CoNCx/NiFeO to contain CoOx/Co0 and Ni0 nanoparticles on a NiFe-mixed metal oxide support. CoNCx/NiFeO showed very high initial activity and selectivity for the hydrogenation of HMF to DMF in tetrahydrofuran (THF) under mild reaction conditions (180 °C, 1.0 MPa H2, 6.0 h), evidenced by a 99.8% HMF conversion and 94.3% DMF selectivity. Reaction pathways for the conversion of HMF to DMF over CoNCx/NiFeO were revealed by monitoring the intermediates formed at different stages of the reaction.

The dimer and trimer products of this reaction can be used as precursors for biofuels upon oxygen removal and thus have relevance in environmental sustainability. MgO(111) maintained impressive selectivity towards the dimer product after carbon coating, whereas the other catalysts experienced a decrease in conversion and selectivity as a consequence of the carbon coating.

The problem is that the world is running out of fossil fuel. Therefore, an alternative source must be identified. The biofuels are promising alternatives. In the case of petrodiesel, a promising alternative is biodiesel production from algae. The ability of microalgae to generate large quantities of lipids with a fast growth rate made them superior biodiesel producers. An important factor of determining optimal microalgal activity is the bioresponse to changes in trace metal concentration and quantity. The effects of the addition of the following chemicals were investigated: ferric oxide (Fe2O3) with a concentration of 1.2 mg/L, manganese dioxide (MnO2) with a concentration of 1 mg/L, magnesium oxide (MgO) with a concentration of 7.3 mg/L, and zinc oxide (ZnO) with a concentration of 5 mg/L. Further treatment is a mixture of all additives with the same listed concentrations. According to the results of this study, it was found that iron, manganese, magnesium, and zinc concentration have great influence on the algal growth and lipid production.

It is widely recognized that considerable amounts of hydrogen (H2) can be produced from renewable resources without using energy from fossil fuels. Biological processes and bacterial fermentation are considered as the most environmentally friendly alternatives for satisfying future hydrogen demand. Biohydrogen production from agricultural and agro-industrial solid waste and wastewater is considered as highly advantageous as materials of this kind are abundant, cheap and biodegradable. The combustion of H2 with oxygen produces water as its only product: Unlike other fuels, the combustion of H2 does not produce carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), hydrocarbons or particulate matter (PM). Therefore, hydrogen is an environmentally friendly fuel where endeavors focus on producing specially designed internal combustion engines that can use H2 as fuel. The results showed that laser irradiated inoculum increased biohydrogen production by 1.2 times of the control. Therefore, in this research, it was hypothesized that exposing purple non-sulfur bacterial (PNSB) mix consortium to Helium-Neon red laser for 2 hours increased cell activity and consequently the biohydrogen production from food wastes through photo-fermentation process. © 2022 National Information and Documentation Center (NIDOC).","Anaerobic treatment; Biofuels; Biohydrogen; Biomass; Laser irradiation; Photobiostimulation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120830891

Transesterification reaction was performed by both enzyme (lipase) and chemical (potassium hydroxide) catalyst with diverse acyl acceptors such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, n-propanol, butanol, n- butanol, and finally their biodiesel yield were also recorded. Process optimization was performed by both one factor at a time method and response surface method. The maximal biodiesel yield of 92% (weight/weight) was obtained at the following optimal conditions: Oil:Methanol molar ratio of 1:6 (moles/moles), the lipase concentration of 2% (weight/weight), at 35 ​°C and 120 ​min. The highest biodiesel yield from Cassia auriculata oil was occurred with excess methanol that aids the equilibrium shift in the forward direction. The kinetics of the transesterification reaction was investigated under optimal conditions and the activation energy was found to be 14.91 ​kJ/mol. Simultaneously Gas Chromatography – Mass Spectroscopy was also carried out for the biodiesel produced from Cassia auriculata and the same has been reported. The GC analysis declares the existence of fatty acid esters like hexadecanoic acid methyl ester, methyl stearate and the peak with retention time 12.8 ​min signifies the evidence of hexadecanoic acid methyl ester with 28% of yield content. This investigation also evaluated the biodiesel quality produced from lipase-transesterified Cassia auriculata oil based on fuel properties. Biodiesel properties Flash Point (FC), Pour Point (PP) and kinematic viscosity were compared with American (ASTM 6751) and European (EN 14214) Standards. Cassia auriculata oil had PP 6.7 ​°C and Kinematic viscosity (813 ​kg/m3) that agreed with both the standards.

To compare the Mn (0 and 4 at.%)-doped TiO2 was also synthesized using muffle combustion. FESEM images and 3D surface analyses exhibited the cheese-like architecture assembled with nanosheets as well as by large uniform pores. Moreover, it showed that Mn played three significant roles. First, Mn promoted the rutile phase. Second, according to TPD-NH3 results, Mn dopant boosted acid sites, and acid density of catalyst as the number of acid sites was 35.534, and 42.777 µmol/g and acid density were 0.331, and 0.641 µmol/m2 for undoped TiO2 and 4at. % Mn-doped TiO2, respectively.

Catalytic pyrolysis of waste edible oils was used as a resource for the production of biodiesel using synthetic chemically modified alumina catalyst. The catalyst was synthesized based on chemical modification of ZSM-5 platform by organic precursor followed by sulphonation, to yield highly effective acidic heterogeneous catalyst. The synthetic catalyst was characterized using FTIR, XRD, TPD, and TGA analysis to determine its chemical structure.

In this study, a heterogeneous cobalt doping Zn/Al complex oxide was prepared by a simple birch-templating method, and successfully applied to the transesterification of jatropha oil with methanol. The catalyst had strong diffraction peaks of ZnAl2O4 spinel crystal with substitutional doping of amorphous cobalt atom. It had a tendency to achieve a high base strength whilst increasing the specific surface area in the presence of cobalt. By contrast to the impregnation and coprecipitation methods, the crystalline particles from templating method were uniformly distributed on the catalyst surface, thus forming a well-defined tiled network with large amounts of grain-free pores. The exposure of available activity sites resulted in a biodiesel yield of 91.4%. After used several times and recycled, the regenerated catalyst also exhibited good catalytic potency without obvious deactivation. The transesterification kinetics satisfied the Pseudo first order model that controlled by the reaction temperature and catalyst dosage.

The oil source for biofuel was taken to do the detailed study and experimental work. From the experimental work, the most important characteristics, which are necessary to identify the performance and combustion, the quality of the fuel used in an engine. The engine taken for the fuel study was a single cylinder, four stroke, water cooled DI engine. All tests were conducted at different engine speeds as 1800 rpm, 2000 rpm, 2200 rpm. 2400 rpm and 2800 rpm. The Brake Thermal Efficiency (BTE), Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC), and Brake Power (BP) reflects the combustion status within the engine and the emission CO, CO2, NOX, and HC gives the emission tendency of the fuel used that has to be reduced. The naturally plentiful plant of citrullus coloncynthis L. seeds were used for the biodiesel production. Four different fuel combinations were tried in the engine as D100 (Pure diesel), CC10 (Citrullus coloncynthis biofuel 10% + Diesel 90%), CC20 (Citrullus coloncynthis biofuel 20% + Diesel 80%) and CC30 (Citrullus coloncynthis biofuel 30% + Diesel 70%). From the results, it is evident that the use of CC Biofuel with 10% provides little lower value of BTE and BP and slightly higher BSFC than the pure diesel results. Considering the emission nature, it highly reduced the emission of CO and HC except NOX and CO2. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiesel; Brake thermal efficiency; Citrullus coloncynthis L.; Combustion; Emissions","Biodiesel; Brakes; Carbon dioxide; Diesel engines; Efficiency; Fossil fuels; Nitrogen oxides; Plants (botany); Seed; Brake thermal efficiency; Citrulli coloncynthis L; Combustion characteristics; Combustion emissions; Combustion performance; Emission; Emission characteristics; Performance and emissions; Performance characteristics; Specific fuel consumption; Combustion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114772464

Further, to investigate the capacity of the biogasoline fraction as well as the bio gasoline blends with fossil gasoline in increasing its efficiency. The porous morphology, pore distribution and surface area, elemental composition and phase formation of catalysts were analysed by Scanning electron Microscopy, Surface area analyser and X-ray diffraction techniques. All the synthesized materials were crystalline and least changes were observed with incorporation of CaO on SBA-15. The morphology of the materials were as expected without much agglomeration. SBA-15 exhibited fair surface area of around 1300 m2/g and discrete pores gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC–MS). Among the catalysts, the composite material, CaO/SBA-15 (4 wt%) efficiently cracked 97% of used cooking oil into 70% liquid products and 69.7% of biogasoline which was confirmed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS). BioG showed a good Calorific value of 10000 MJ/Kg which was comparable to that of petroleum fuel. Results of the engine test indicated that using biogasoline–gasoline blended fuels, torque output and fuel consumption of the engine increased when compared to gasoline; CO and SO2 emissions decreased largely due to the oxidation, CO2 emission increased because of the improved combustion and NOX emission from bio gasoline blends was low than gasoline. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Biofuels; CO, SO2; Fuel consumption; Torque; Used cooking oil","Catalysts; Engines; Gas chromatography; Gasoline; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Morphology; Scanning electron microscopy; CO, SO2; Emission characteristics; Fixed bed; Gaschromatography-mass spectrometry; Gasoline blends; Liquid hydrocarbons; SBA-15 catalysts; Surface area; Used cooking oil; ]+ catalyst; Blending",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114391446

Although microalgae are a feasible source of biofuel, industrial microalgae applications face energy and cost challenges. To overcome these challenges, researchers have been interested in applying the bio-refinery approach to extract the important components encapsulated in microalgae. This review discusses the key steps of microalgae-based biorefinery including cultivation and harvesting, cell disruption, biofuel and value-added compound extraction along with the detailed technologies associated with each step of biorefinery. This review found that suitable microalgae species are selected based on their carbohydrate, lipid and protein contents and selecting the suitable species are crucial for high-quality biofuel and value-added products production. Microalgae species contain carbohydrates, proteins and lipids in the range of 8% to 69.7%, 5% to 74% and 7% to 65% respectively which proved their ability to be used as a source of value-added commodities in multiple industries including agriculture, animal husbandry, medicine, culinary, and cosmetics. This review suggests that lipid and value-added products from microalgae can be made more economically viable by integrating upstream and downstream processes. Therefore, a systematically integrated genome sequencing and process-scale engineering approach for improving the extraction of lipids and co-products is critical in the development of future microalgal biorefineries. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Biohydrogen; Fourth-generation biofuel; Medicine, animal feed, pigment; Photobioreactor; Third generation biodiesel","Animals; Bioconversion; Biodiesel; Bioethanol; Biomass; Carbohydrates; Carbon dioxide; Cultivation; Extraction; Global warming; Lipids; Microorganisms; Proteins; Refining; Bio-based; Bio-hydrogen; Biorefineries; Fourth-generation biofuel; Integrated biorefinery; Medicine, animal feed, pigment; Micro-algae; Photobiore-actor; Third generation biodiesel; Value added products; Algae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114020511

This research deals with the production and utilization of waste cooking oil biodiesel and nanoparticles blends in the direct ignition engine. The nanoparticles added blends was then reinforced with hydrogen flow while conducting the tests. The fuel blends used for the tests were D100 (pure diesel), B10 (90% diesel + 10% biofuel), B20 (80% diesel + 20% biofuel), D100T10 (pure diesel with 100 ppm nanoparticles), B10TH (90% diesel + 10% biofuel with 100 ppm nanoparticles + 5 L/min of H2) and B20T10 (80% diesel + 20% biofuel with 100 ppm nanoparticles + 5 L/min of H2). While conducting the tests, the hydrogen flow was given at the constant mass flow rate of 10 L/min. The performance and emission measures were keenly calculated from the tests. All tests were conducted at different speeds from 1800 rpm to 2800 rpm. The performance parameters were improved by these nanoparticles and hydrogen together with the pure diesel and also with the biodiesel blends. For example, the power, torque and brake thermal efficiency were improved while the brake specific fuel consumption was decreased.

Five different strains of microalgae were identified, viz. Nannochloropsis salina (N. salina), Dunaliella salina (D. salina), Chaetoceros calcitrans (C. calcitrans), Tetraselmis chuii (T. chuii), and Euglena sanguinea (E. sanguinea). Further, these stains were mass cultivated in a 250-L bioreactor to assess their biomass production ability. At the end of the exponential phase, algal biomass was harvested for lipid extraction. The fatty acid profile and physico-chemical properties of the lipids were analyzed. It was observed that a maximum of 27.67wt% of lipid was obtained for N. salina followed by D. salina (22.58 wt%), E. sanguinea (21.88 wt%), T. chuii (20.15 wt%), and C. calcitrans (16.25 wt%). Subsequently, the extracted lipids were subjected to single-step esterification and transesterification process to produce biodiesel by using an acid catalyst. The different parameters influencing the reaction such as catalyst concentration, temperature, methanol to lipid molar ratio, and time were investigated. A maximum biodiesel yield of 97, 94, 96, 92, and 92 wt% were obtained for N. salina, D. salina, C. calcitrans, T. chuii, and E. sanguinea, respectively, at the favorable reaction conditions.

This research paper explores the detailed information on the improved production, emission and performance characteristics of the distinct bio-oil derived from the micro algae of Schizochytrium. The algae were grown in the artificial seawater with enough nitrogen supply at the required standard conditions. The lipid growth and production of the bio-oil were monitored closely and measured. Different fuel blends were used at different concentrations as B0 (100% Diesel), B10 (10% schizochytrium biofuel +90% diesel), B20 (20% schizochytrium biofuel +80% diesel) and B30 (30% schizochytrium biofuel +70% diesel). A small single cylinder, four stroke diesel engine was used to conduct the tests. All tests were conducted at different speed conditions of 1200 rpm to 2100 rpm in six intervals. The performance qualities of bio-oil such as CO, NOX, and smoke and CO2 emission along with the performance qualities of brake thermal efficiency and brake specific fuel consumption. Form the results, the Schizochytrium microalgae bio-oil as the bio fuel for diesel engines in the moderate level showed the improved performance by increasing the BTE and reducing the harmful gas emissions except NOX. However, the emission level of NOX was slightly higher than the diesel emitted value. The difference between them was negligible. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Biodiesel; Combustion; Emission; Microalgae; Schizochytrium sp.","Algae; Biodiesel; Brakes; Combustion; Diesel engines; Energy transfer; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Integrated circuits; Neutron emission; Nitrogen oxides; Smoke; Timing circuits; Algal biodiesels; Bio-oils; Combustion energies; Emission; Energy-transfer; Micro-algae; Performance quality; PM emissions; Schizochytria sp.; Schizochytrium; Microorganisms; ammonium sulfate; biodiesel; biogas; calcium chloride; carbon dioxide; cobalt chloride; copper sulfate; cyanocobalamin; ferrous sulfate; fossil fuel; glycerol; lactic acid; magnesium sulfate; manganese chloride; molybdate sodium; nickel sulfate; nitrogen; pantothenic acid; potassium dihydrogen phosphate; potassium sulfate; sea water; sodium sulfate; sucrose; thiamine; zinc sulfate; biofuel; carbon monoxide; gasoline; nitrogen oxide; algal bloom; biofuel; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; combustion; experimental study; fossil fuel; particulate matter; algae growth; analytical parameters; Article; biodegradability; brake specific fuel consumption; brake thermal efficiency; calorific value; carbon dioxide fixation; clinical assessment; combustion energy; compression ratio; controlled study; diesel particulate matter; emission rate; energy transfer; exhaust gas temperature; flash point; fuel consumption; greenhouse gas emission; Kinematic viscosity; lipid composition; lipid production; nitrogen supply; nonhuman; Particulate emission; particulate matter; performance; pH; photosynthesis; primary production (biomass); rotation; salinity; Schizochytrium; sea pollution; smoke; temperature; thermal efficiency; transesterification; velocity; energy transfer; exhaust gas; Schizochytrium; Biofuels; Carbon Monoxide; Energy Transfer; Gasoline; Nitrogen Oxides; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113514624

The pyrolysis process converts biomass to value-added products such as biochar, bio-oil, and hydrocarbon gases based on the heating rates and temperature. To enhance the pyrolytic activity of mustard biomass, magnetically separable and reusable FeNi alloy catalyst is investigated. The thermo-conversion properties are studied under variable heating rates with 2 and 10% FeNi particles prepared through a facile chemical reduction technique. Thermal kinetics is computed using Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FOW) and Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) methods. The activation energies calculated using FOW and KAS methods increase with FeNi addition in mustard while the calorific value decreases. The FeNi alloy particles with the spike-like morphology provide better metal-biomass binding resulting in higher activation energy and facilitates the easy decomposition of lignin. The 10% FeNi -mustard shows uniform conversion independent of heating rates, suitable for magnetically recoverable catalytic pyrolysis. Response surface methodology analysis predicts optimum conversion for 10% FeNi added mustard and less significance for the heating rates in concurrence with the experiments.

Herein, this study we prepared empty fruit bunch-based activated carbon (EFBHAC) using HTC technique. The activated carbon was then functionalized with K2CO3 and Cu(NO3)2 to produce bifunctional nano-catalyst for simultaneous esterification-transesterification of waste cooking oil (WCO). The physicochemical properties were performed i.e. N2 sorptions analysis, TPD-CO2/NH3, FESEM, EDX, FTIR and XRD analysis. The results revealed that produced EFBHAC possessed a BET surface area of 4056.17 m2 g−1, with pore volume of 0.827 cm3 g−1 and 5.42 nm of pore diameter resulting from hydrolysis, dehydration decarboxylation, aromatization and re-condensation during HTC process. Impregnation of EFBHAC with K2CO3 and Cu(NO3)2 granted a high amount of basicity and acidity of 9.21 mmol g−1 and 31.41 mmol g−1, respectively, accountable to high biodiesel yield of 97.1%, produced at the optimum condition of 5 wt% of catalyst loading, 12:1 of methanol to oil molar ratio at 70 °C for 2 h. More than 80% of biodiesel was produced after the 5th cycle depicted the good reusability. The transformations from WCO to biodiesel was confirmed via 1H NMR, FTIR and TGA analysis. Fuel properties revealed kinematic viscosity of 3.3 mm2 s−1, cetane number of 51, flash point of 160.5 °C, cloud and pour point of 11 °C and −3 °C, respectively.

The primary concerns of sustainable alcohol production for meeting the growing energy demand owing to the selection of viable feedstock and this might enhance the opportunities for developing numerous advanced techniques. In this review, the valorization of alcohol production from several production routes has been exposed by covering the traditional routes to the present state of the art technologies. Even though the fossil fuel conversion could be dominant method for methanol production, many recent innovations like photo electrochemical synthesis and electrolysis methods might play vital role in production of renewable methanol in future. There have been several production routes for production of ethanol and among which the fermentation of lignocellulose biomass would be the ultimate choice for large scale shoot up. The greenhouse gas recovery in the form of alcohols through electrochemistry technique and hydrogenation method are the important methods for commercialization of alcohols in future. It is also observed that algae based renewable bio-alcohols is highly influenced by carbohydrate content and sustainable approaches in algae conversion to bio-alcohols would bring greater demand in future market. There is a lack of innovation in higher alcohols production in single process and this could be bounded by combining dehydrogenation and decarboxylation techniques. Finally, this review enlists the opportunities and challenges of existing alcohols production and recommended the possible routes for making significant enhancement in production. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Alcohol production; Alternative energy; Biofuels; Environmental sustainability; Fermentation; Valorization","Algae; Biofuels; Electrochemistry; Feedstocks; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Methanol; Sustainable development; Alcohol production; Alternative energy; Bio alcohols; Biofuel economies; Current change; Environmental sustainability; Potential feedstock; Production route; Property; Valorisation; Fermentation; alcohol; butanol; carbon dioxide; fossil fuel; lignocellulose; molasses; starch; alcohol; biofuel; ether derivative; alcohol; biofuel; commercialization; crop residue; decarboxylation; electrochemistry; ether; alcohol production; alga; Article; biomass; biosynthesis; carbohydrate analysis; decarboxylation; dehydrogenation; electrochemistry; electrolysis; fermentation; food grain; hydrogenation; municipal solid waste; nonhuman; valorization; Biofuels; Biomass; Ethanol; Ethers; Fermentation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110681517

Methods and Results: The Au@Ag NPs structure was examined by UV-vis spectrophotometer, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR). All devices were used to characterize Au@Ag NPs and confirmed successful synthesis of nanoparticles. Fungal lipid was quantitatively determined by sulfo-phospho-vanillin colorimetric method. Among 15 F. solani isolates obtained from rhizospheric soils of the date palm, F. solani (AF12) was chosen as the highly significant producer that accumulates above 20% lipid. The maximum biodiesel yield was 91.28 ± 0.19%, obtained under the optimum reaction conditions of 3% Au@Ag NPs as nanocatalyst concentration, and 1:20 oil to methanol molar ratio at 70℃ for 30 min. HPLC method was applied for monitoring in situ transesterification reaction. FTIR spectroscopy was used in qualitative analysis of biodiesel by verifying the presence of unique characteristic peaks of diagnostic significance. The quality of the biodiesel produced was confirmed by the high purity of fatty acid methyl esters analysis content up to >99%. Conclusions: These findings propose the applicability of F. solani (FS12) as a promising isolate to accumulate lipids and biodiesel production as a feedstock. Significance and Impact of the Study: The link between nanotechnology and fungi. Au@Ag NPs were synthesized at room temperature, which displayed high catalytic activity for in situ transesterification reaction. Catalytic activity appeared at low temperature, mole ratio and short reaction time. Oleaginous fungi are described as easily grown, have short life cycle, are cost-effective, and they utilized various sources of carbon up to waste and a simplified process to develop scale-up production as well, economic value, opposite the usage of vegetable oils which need for large agricultural areas. © 2021 The Society for Applied Microbiology",,"biodiesel; core shell nanoparticle; gold nanoparticle; lipid; silver nanoparticle; biofuel; gold; lipid; metal nanoparticle; silver; biofuel; catalysis; catalyst; fatty acid; lipid; nanoparticle; nanotechnology; paralytic shellfish poisoning; shell; Article; clinical article; colorimetry; controlled study; flow rate; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; fungal biomass; Fusarium solani; high performance liquid chromatography; lipid composition; nanocatalyst; nonhuman; pH; soil; thin layer chromatography; transesterification; transmission electron microscopy; ultraviolet spectrophotometry; X ray diffraction; fungus; Biofuels; Fungi; Gold; Lipids; Metal Nanoparticles; Silver",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109888208

Here, we show that, upon sulfation, zirconia catalysts exhibit a significant increase in their Brønsted and Lewis acid strength, whereas their Lewis basicity is significantly reduced. Such changes in the interplay between acid–base sites result in an improvement of the selectivity toward the ketonization process, although the measured conversion rates show a significant drop. We report a detailed DFT investigation of the putative surface species on sulfated zirconia, including the possible formation of dimeric pyrosulfate (S2O72–) species. Our results show that the formation of such a dimeric system is an endothermic process, with energy barriers ranging between 60.0 and 70.0 kcal mol–1, and which is likely to occur only at high SO42– coverages (4 S/nm2), high temperatures, and dehydrating conditions. Conversely, the formation of monomeric species is expected at lower SO42– coverages, mild temperatures, and in the presence of water, which are the usual conditions experienced during the chemical upgrading of biofuels. © 2021 The Authors.

In this article, bifunctional Pt-Mo catalyst supported on activated carbon (AC) was fabricated for in situ hydrogenation of methyl stearate to alkanes using small amounts of formic acid (FA) as a hydrogen source. A total yield of 75.3% is obtained under 290 °C for 2 h with a small FA/methyl stearate mole ratio of 3.9. Prolonging the reaction time to 6 h results in a total yield of 100%. The experimental and characterization results indicate that the strong interaction of β-Mo2C and Pt over Pt-Mo/AC catalysts give rise to excellent catalytic performance and that Pt active sites are responsible for FA dehydrogenation and decarbonylation of methyl stearate to heptadecane and Pt-doped β-Mo2C active sites catalyzing hydrodeoxygenation of methyl stearate to octadenane.

The response surface methodology (RSM) coupled to a factorial design (2³) with a central composite rotatable design (CCRD) was used for optimization. The effects of temperature, catalyst percentage, palm olein:ethanol molar ratio, and their interactions were evaluated. A reaction time of 10 h was established relating conversion versus time, and the stirring speed was determined by assessing the conversion potential ranging from 250 to 1000 rpm. The reactions were performed in a jacketed reactor coupled to a thermostatic bath. The mixtures of triacylglycerols (TAG), diacylglycerols (DAG), monoacylglycerols (MAG), fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE), and ethanol were quantified by high-pressure size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC), and glycerol content was determined by stoichiometry. A second-order model was adjusted to explain the experimental data from the 18 factorial design trials. A conversion of approximately 98.10 % in ethyl esters was obtained from the optimised variables using a 17.6 % catalyst, palm olein:ethanol molar ratio of 1:12.85 at 49.4 °C.

The use of different renewable feedstock materials are vital in the satisfaction of large-scale demand for renewable energy sources without creating environmental problems in order to satisfy energy demand. In this context we covered the production of biofuels from a variety of feedstocks using pyrolysis, direct blending, micro-emulsion, trans-esterification (biodiesel production techniques) and hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, methanogenesis (biogas production techniques) and pyrolysis, thermochemical liquefaction (bio-oil production techniques) along with the focus on increasing biofuel production using nanocatalysts and biochar-based catalysts and the techniques for creating those catalysts. Torrefaction, pyrolysis, hydrothermal carbonization, hydrothermal liquefaction, and gasification are the key methods used to make biochar. Slow pyrolysis and hydrothermal carbonisation are the best methods to produce high-yield biochar. Biochar's catalytic activity is influenced by pyrolysis temperature, pyrolysis time, transition metals, and biomass to water mass ratio. However, there are some noteworthy challenges associated with biofuel development. The cost of feedstock and the option of convenient technology for efficient fuel production, the availability of commercially viable nanoparticles, a biological understanding of the nanomaterial and protein system, and microorganism compatibility levels involving enzymes and nanomaterials are all discussed repeatedly. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Biofuels; Heterogeneous catalysts; Homogeneous catalysts; Nanocatalysts; Renewable energy; Synthesis techniques","Biofuels; Blending; Carbonization; Catalyst activity; Emulsification; Feedstocks; Fossil fuels; Liquefaction; Nanocatalysts; Nanostructured materials; Renewable energy resources; Transition metals; Bio chars; Biofuel production; Heterogeneous catalyst; Homogeneous catalyst; Hydrothermal carbonization; Nano-catalyst; Production techniques; Renewable energies; Synthesis techniques; ]+ catalyst; Pyrolysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113687450

For the direct electrooxidation, metallic catalysts were used, whose surfaces were modified by promoters or second catalysts. Bi-modified Pt electrodes (PtxBiy/C) served as model systems for promoter-supported electrocatalysis, whereas IrO2-modified RuO2 electrodes were studied as catalyst combinations, which were compared under acidic conditions with the respective monometallic catalysts (Pt/C, RuO2/Ti, IrO2/Ti). Furthermore, inorganic halide mediators (chloride, bromide, iodide) and organic nitroxyl mediators (4-oxo-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidin-1-oxyl and 4-acetamido-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidin-1-oxyl) were evaluated for indirect electrooxidation.

The chemocatalytic production of biodiesel from plant oils is widely used in industrial production due to its low cost and high conversion rate. However, the disadvantages are high energy consumption and environmentally unfriendly processing such as chemical catalysts, downstream technology and simultaneously produced waste. Therefore, in the past decade, enzyme-catalyzed biodiesel has attracted more attentions due to its sustainability and environmental friendliness. High-cost, enzyme stability and reusability are the main obstacles to the large-scale industrial development of microbial biodiesel. This review first showcases the state-of-the-art of microbial biodiesel production, including (1) lipid accumulation of oleaginous microorganisms from pretreated lignocellulose biomass, and (2) production of biodiesel from microbial oils via transesterification by immobilized lipase. Also, the technological challenges and future developmental trends are discussed, with the goal of providing the possibility of more economical large-scale industrial production.

The conventional transesterification of edible, nonedible, or waste cook-ing oils to produce biodiesel is always accompanied by the formation of glycerol as the by-product. Undeniably, it is essential to economically use this by-product to produce a range of valuable fuels and chemicals to ensure the sustainability of the transesterification process. Therefore, recently, glycerol has been used as a feedstock for the production of value-added H2 and chemicals. In this review, the recent advances in the catalytic conversion of glycerol to H2 and high-value chemicals are thoroughly discussed. Specifically, the activity, stability, and recyclability of the catalysts used in the steam reforming of glycerol for H2 production are covered. In addition, the behavior and performance of heterogeneous catalysts in terms of the roles of active metal and support toward the formation of acrolein, lactic acid, 1,3-propanediol, and 1,2-propanediol from glycerol are reviewed. Recommendations for future research and main conclusions are provided.

Biodiesel produced from waste, non-edible seed oils is a cleaner, green and alternate source of fuel for diesel engines which can possibly add to circular bioeconomy. In this study, Citrus aurantium a novel, nonedible and waste seed oil (38% w/w) producing feedstock was subjected to biodiesel synthesis using recyclable zirconium oxide nano particles synthesized with Alternanthera pungens aqueous leave extract. Maximum yield of 94% was obtained through optimized reaction parameters of methanol to oil molar ratio 6:1, reaction time 120 min, temperature 87.5 °C and catalyst loading of 0.5 wt% using Response Surface Methodology. Green nano particles of zirconium oxide were characterized via Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Energy diffraction X-Ray (EDX) while; physiochemical characterization of synthesized biodiesel was carried through Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Gas Chromatography/Mass spectroscopy (GC/MS), and Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR 1H and 13C). Fuel properties of methyl ester met international standards of ASTM D-6571, EN 14214 and China GB/T 20828-2007. It was concluded that biodiesel production from Citrus aurantium waste and non-edible seed oil can be efficiently employed for generation of renewable energy which would further provide assistance in transformation of linear economy to circular bioeconomy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiesel; Circular bioenergy; Citrus aurantium; Non-edible seeds; Waste; Zirconium oxide","Economics; Energy policy; Esters; Fossil fuels; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Gas chromatography; Molar ratio; Nanoparticles; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Oxides; Scanning electron microscopy; Synthesis (chemical); Zirconium compounds; Bio-energy; Circular bioenergy; Citrus aurantium; Edible seed oil; Methyl esters; Nanoparti-cles; Non-edible seed; Recyclables; Seed oil; Synthesised; Biodiesel; biodiesel; nanoparticle; vegetable oil; zirconium oxide; biofuel; ester; vegetable oil; zirconium; zirconium oxide; bioenergy; biofuel; fruit; nanoparticle; plant extract; seed; waste; zirconium; Article; bioenergy; carbon nuclear magnetic resonance; catalysis; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; mass fragmentography; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance; physical chemistry; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; reaction analysis; renewable energy; scanning electron microscopy; sour orange; X ray diffraction; Citrus; esterification; Alternanthera pungens; Citrus aurantium; Biofuels; Catalysis; Citrus; Esterification; Esters; Nanoparticles; Plant Oils; Zirconium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118546526

The colloidal PdNP-PANi/CMs were used to modify the electrode interface of a highly sensitive non-enzymatic sensor. The morphology and electrochemical properties of the catalyst and electrode were characterized by SEM, EDX, FTIR, XRD, and electrochemical methods. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was the model analyte. The catalytic efficiency of the PdNP-PANi/CMs/GCE toward H2O2 was evaluated via the scan rate effect and chronoamperometric measurement, which showed a diffusion-controlled process with a high diffusion coefficient (D = (3.4 ± 0.5) × 10−3 cm2 s−1) and catalytic rate constant (kcat = (4.50 ± 0.02) × 107 mol−1 cm3 s−1). A response time within 5 s and excellent sensitivity (234 µA mM−1 cm−2) were obtained. The proposed electrode provided a linear concentration range between 0.002 and 10 mM with a limit of detection of 0.70 µM. Operationally, the PdNP-PANi/CMs/GCE exhibited good electrocatalytic stability and good repeatability, reproducibility, and selectivity. The applicability of the developed sensor was proved by the determination of H2O2 in human seminal fluid. Recoveries were in the range of 97 ± 2% to 102 ± 3%.

Biodiesel was produced from soybean waste cooking oil (SWCO) by trans-esterification process based on a heterogeneous catalyst and methanol. 307 L stainless steel was used to assess the metal surface corrosion after direct contact with the biofuel. The different changes in the biodiesel composition were investigated by FTIR, GS-MS, and UV-absorbance, while the corrosion effect was evaluated by electrochemical methods, SEM/EDS microscopy techniques, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, and UV–Vis–NIR absorbance. The results reveal a weak influence of methyl ester on metal degradation, indicating a low corrosion rate with a localized micro pitting on its surface. Moreover, flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS) showed the existence of a diminutive number of metal ions, and the electrochemical assays such as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and the polarization curves (PC) exhibited a great corrosion resistance of the 307 L stainless steel by the formation of a passive film. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","307 L stainless steel corrosion; Biodiesel; Electrochemical assays; SEM/EDS/XRD; UV–Vis–NIR","Absorption spectroscopy; Biodiesel; Corrosion rate; Corrosion resistance; Corrosive effects; Electrochemical corrosion; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Esters; Flame resistance; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Fuel storage; Metal ions; Metals; Soybean oil; Stainless steel; X ray diffraction analysis; Biodiesel degradation; Electrochemical assays; ELectrochemical methods; Flame atomic absorption spectroscopy; Heterogeneous catalyst; Microscopy technique; Oxidative stability; Polarization curves; Steel corrosion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114880605

XRD, BET, FE-SEM, TEM and TPD techniques were employed for catalysts characterization. The highest biodiesel yield (98.08%) was achieved under the transesterification condition of 65 °C, 6 h, 24 methanol/oil molar ratio and 2 wt% of LiNbO3 as the catalyst. The results showed that LiNbO3 could be efficiently reused at least 10 cycles with an insignificant reduction in the biodiesel yield. The physicochemical properties of the biodiesel were further studied and compared with the ASTM and the EN biodiesel specifications. The results showed that the properties of the biodiesel produced complied with the international standard specifications. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Acid-base bifunctional heterogeneous; Biodiesel; Niobium oxide; Solid-state reaction; Transesterification","acid; alkali metal; base; biodiesel; carbonic acid derivative; diacylglycerol; lithium ion; methanol; monoacylglycerol; niobium; phosphorus; potassium; sodium ion; soybean oil; sulfur; triacylglycerol; biofuel; soybean oil; alkali metal; biofuel; catalysis; catalyst; chemical reaction; composite; detection method; adsorption; Article; atmospheric pressure; biofuel production; catalyst; catalytic efficiency; controlled study; desorption; esterification; field emission scanning electron microscopy; one pot synthesis; physical chemistry; pore size distribution; pore volume; reaction temperature; reaction time; reduction (chemistry); solid state; surface area; transesterification; transmission electron microscopy; X ray diffraction; catalysis; Glycine max; Biofuels; Catalysis; Esterification; Methanol; Soybean Oil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114021288

The advantage of employing biomass for combustion is emerging as a potential renewable energy, which is regarded as a cheap fuel. Chemical constituents or elements are essential properties in biomass applications, which would be costly and labor-intensive to experimentally estimate them. One of the criteria to evaluate the energy of biomass from an economic perspective is the higher heating value (HHV). In the present work, we have applied multilayer perceptron artificial neural network (MLP-ANN), least-squares support vector machine (LSSVM), ant colony-adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ACO-ANFIS), particle swarm optimization- ANFIS (PSO-ANFIS), genetic algorithm-radial basis function (GA-RBF) and new multivariate nonlinear regression (MNR) as accurate correlation methods to estimate HHVs of biomass fuels based on the ultimate analysis. 535 experimental data were gathered from literature and categorized into eight classes of by-products of fruits, agri-wastes, wood chips/tree species, grasses/leaves/fibrous materials, other waste materials, briquettes/charcoals/pellets, cereal and Industrial wastes. In the term of statistical analysis, average absolute relative deviation (AARD) authenticates that MNR and GA-RBF algorithm with %AARD of 3.5 and 3.4 could be used to estimate HHV. In addition, developed models results were compared to the results of 69 recently previously published empirical correlations and it confirms the reliability of our results. Relevency factor shows the impact of biomass elements on HHV and outlier analysis indicates the unreliable experimental data. The results of this study can be used by researchers to design and optimize biomass combustion systems. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Bioenergy; Biofuel; Biomass; Correlation; Model; Ultimate analysis","Ant colony optimization; Biofuels; Calorific value; Chemical analysis; Fossil fuels; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Genetic algorithms; Machine learning; Multilayer neural networks; Municipal solid waste; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Radial basis function networks; Waste incineration; Average absolute relative deviations; Bio-energy; Biomass fuels; Correlation; Higher heating value; Machine learning techniques; Multivariate non-linear regression; Radial basis; Sustainable economy; Ultimate analysis; Biomass; biofuel; biomass; combustion; heating; machine learning; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111875813

Under the optimum conditions obtained from 3D plots of response surface methodology design, the Kocuria flava ASU5 biocatalyst exhibited an 83.08% yield of biodiesel at optimized reaction variables of, 60 ○C, pH value 8 and 1:2 oil/alcohol molar ratios in the reaction mixture. As well as, the obtained results showed the interactions of temperature/methanol were significant effects, whereas this was not noted in the case of temperature/pH and pH/methanol interactions. The obtained amount of biodiesel from cooking oil was 83.08%, which was analyzed by a GC/Ms profile. The produced biodiesel was confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) approaches showing an absorption band at 1743 cm−1, which is recognized for its absorption in the carbonyl group (C=O) which is characteristic of ester absorption. The energy content generated from biodiesel synthesized was estimated as 12,628.5 kJ/mol.

The eggshell has been activated in the muffle furnace at 900°C and was further characterized by using X-ray diffraction analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, thermogravimetric analysis, transmission electron microscopy, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller, and Hammet indicator to study the catalytic behavior of the catalyst. Optimization of transesterification parameters such as methanol-to-oil ratio, methanol-to-cosolvent ratio, catalyst concentration, and reaction time have been investigated using statistical techniques of response surface methodology (RSM) with a central composite design. The empirical value of methyl ester yield obtained from RSM (95.7%) could be comparable with the experimental value (98.1%) and showed that the model shall be considered statistically significant at 97% confidence level. Using Design expert software, by point prediction tool, the experiments were repeated for two times under optimal conditions attained biodiesel yield of 97.2%.

The sulfonation effect was followed by several analytic techniques including X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared, and scanning electron microscopy analysis. The catalytic performance of the sulfonated product was evaluated based on a statistical design which was built according to the response surface methodology and the central composite rotatable design. Using the S-CB acidic catalyst in the transesterification of spent SFO resulted in an actual biodiesel yield of 96% at studied conditions of 85 min at reaction interval, 50 °C as temperature,15:1 as methanol/oil ratio, and 3.5 wt % as S-CB loading. Moreover, the optimization function suggested enhancement to obtained yield up to 97.9% by selecting the values of temperature at 62 °C, the time at 98.5 min, the methanol/SFO ratio at 14.4:1, and S-CB loading at 3.4 wt %. The technical evaluation of the SFO biodiesel reflected the suitability of the product to be used as biofuels according to international standards. The kinetic behavior of the SFO transesterification reaction over S-CB is of pseudo-first order properties and of low activation energy. Finally, the synthetic S-CB as a solid acidic catalyst is of significant reusability and was reused five times with remarkable biodiesel yields. © 2021 The Authors.

In this study, molecular dynamics simulation with reactive force field is performed to investigate the surface instability induced thermal degradation of Ni nanocatalyst and coke deposition induced catalyst deactivation. Coke deposited on catalyst surfaces is a complex mixture of carbonaceous organics. Coke surrogate models containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and oxygenated aromatics are proposed to reflect the molecular size and O/C ratio based on the molecular structures identified during lignin pyrolysis and soot inception mechanism. Lindemann index is used to characterize the degree of crystallinity of catalyst. It is found that atoms at unsaturated sites of outer shell show high mobility and tend to modify the coordination number distribution. Mechanisms behind the effects of temperature, PAH size and oxygen content on coke adsorption are revealed from three aspects of molecular collision dynamics, thermal dynamics and kinetics. The modification of crystallinity of catalyst outer shell and the occurrence of seeping after coke adsorption would affect the subsequent catalyst regeneration. This study is expected to provide guidance on the design of anti-coking catalyst, evaluation of catalyst regeneration and reactor optimisation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass; Catalyst deactivation; Coke deposition; Molecular modelling","Biomass; Catalyst deactivation; Coke; Crystallinity; Lignin; Molecular dynamics; Molecular modeling; Molecular oxygen; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Carbonaceous organics; Catalysts deactivation; Coke deposition; Dynamics simulation; Metal-based catalysts; Organic deposition; Outer shells; Polycyclic aromatics; Thermochemical Conversion; ]+ catalyst; Deposition; adsorption; catalyst; crystallinity; degradation; lignin; molecular analysis; nanomaterial; nickel; thermochemistry; Biomass; Coke; Crystallinity; Deactivation; Deposition; Dynamics; Shells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112284394

The generation of this waste has noticeably increased in specific regions of Morocco as a result of the upward trend in the production of argan oil. Lignin extracted from argan shells via a semi-chemical pulping process was depolymerized under hydrothermal conditions in a stirred autoclave reactor at a temperature range of 250−350 °C. Lignin conversion to phenolic compounds was conducted in subcritical water together with different reaction medium (H2, CO2, and HCOOH). The organic fraction in the aqueous liquid product was extracted and blended with biodiesel at a dosage of 1 wt % to evaluate its antioxidant potential. According to the obtained results, the biodiesel oxidation stability time was drastically improved up to 400%. The depolymerization temperature was observed as a critical factor in the antioxidant potential of the additives, showing a maximum value at 300 °C, regardless of the reaction medium. An extensive characterization of the produced additives was performed. The phenolic monomers present in the produced additives were identified using gas chromatography−mass spectrometry, finding a notable presence of catechol, especially in the additives obtained at 300 °C, which led to the best results of biodiesel oxidation stability. Gel permeation chromatography analyses of the additives also showed a well dissolution of relatively big molecules (up to 7000 Da) in biodiesel. More efforts are required to verify the actual antioxidant potential of these types of molecules. © 2021 The Authors.

Hence, the need to achieve energy sustainability is paramount due to the environmental benefits of biodiesel. In this study, a new approach was reported for biodiesel production from a cheap and readily available waste feedstock, palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD). An environmentally friendly green solvent, dimethyl carbonate (DMC), was utilised in the esterification of free fatty acids present in PFAD. The major influencing reaction parameters were optimised using the Taguchi (L9) orthogonal design, and statistical analysis was employed to determine the percentage contribution of the individual parameter on biodiesel yields. The maximum biodiesel yield of 89.50% was obtained at optimised reaction conditions, using the reaction time of 3.5 h, reaction temperature of 90 °C, DMC to PFAD molar ratio of 10:1 and catalyst concentration of 12 wt%. The percentage contribution of each of the individual parameters on the biodiesel yield was determined as follows: catalyst concentration (51.72%), reaction temperature (30.14%), DMC to PFAD molar ratio (16.94%), and reaction time (1.21%). The mechanism of esterification reaction between PFAD and DMC has also been proposed. This study illustrates that DMC can be successfully employed as an excellent methylating agent for the esterification of PFAD waste feedstock. The validation study also revealed a good agreement between the predicted and experimental values. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiesel; Dimethyl carbonate; Esterification; Palm fatty acid distillate; Taguchi","Carbonation; Catalysts; Esterification; Esters; Fatty acids; Feedstocks; Molar ratio; Sustainable development; Taguchi methods; Biodiesel production; Catalysts concentrations; Dimethyl carbonate; Molar ratio; Palm fatty acid distillate; Production cost; Production process; Reaction temperature; Taguchi; Taguchi optimization method; Biodiesel; biofuel; carbonate; concentration (composition); experimental study; fatty acid; optimization; production cost; statistical analysis; temperature effect",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116642766

Herein, the evaluation of catalytic deoxygenation of waste cooking oil (WCO) over supported Ni-based catalysts was investigated. A series of Ni-based catalysts supported on activated carbon (AC), reduced graphene oxide (rGO), and beta zeolite (Zeo) were prepared via the wet-impregnation method and later carbonised under N2 flow at 550 °C for 4 h. Addition of Ni to AC improves the good physicochemical properties of the catalyst, owing to the high number of acid-base sites, high surface area, smaller crystallite size, and high pore volume of the catalyst. From the catalytic results, Ni20/AC was the most active catalyst by giving 90% hydrocarbon yield and 89% selectivity towards n-(C15 + C17) under H2-free and solvent-free conditions for 3 h at 350 °C and 300 rpm. Furthermore, it was stable up to the fourth cycle with consistent hydrocarbon yield (85–87%) and 66–77% selectively towards n-(C15 + C17). Overall, Ni20/AC shows highly promising catalytic performance due to its good physiochemical properties and high catalyst stability. © 2021","Activated carbon; Deoxygenation; Green diesel; Nickel; Reduced graphene oxide; Waste cooking oil","Activated carbon; Biofuels; Catalyst selectivity; Catalyst supports; Crystallite size; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Hydrocarbons; Nickel oxide; Physicochemical properties; Zeolites; Deoxygenations; Green diesels; Hydrocarbon yield; Ni-based catalyst; Non-edible oil; Non-renewable fuels; Reduced graphene oxides; Renewable diesels; Waste cooking oil; ]+ catalyst; Graphene; activated carbon; alternative fuel; catalysis; catalyst; degradation; oil; oxide; oxygenation; waste technology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116235144

A novel potassium tin oxide (KSO) catalyst was synthesized via polymer precursor auto combustion method. The catalyst showed the best physicochemical properties when it was calcined at 800 °C. Using KSO 800 catalyst, the highest FAME conversion (99.5%) of WFO found at moderated reaction condition within very short time (35 min); moreover, no leaching of K-species was observed in reusability test upto 5th cycle. Kinetics proved that the above catalytic reaction followed pseudo-first-order kinetics and the rate of the reaction was doubled with increasing 10 °C reaction temperature. The reaction activation energy, enthalpy of activation, entropy of activation, and Gibb's free energy of activation of the reaction were found to be 66.52 kJ/mol, 62.95 kJ/mol, −74.07 J/mol/K and 88 kJ/mol respectively. Evaluation of the green parameters revealed that KSO 800 catalyzed transesterification process approached a cleaner route with excellent efficacy in terms of turnover frequency and yield. KSO 800 helped to produce high quality biodiesel from WFO adopting faster and greener reaction pathway.

Firstly, POSS was converted through acidification to be acidified POSS (APOSS) coupled with solvent extraction. APOSS with a high content of free fatty acids (FFAs) (90.94%) was obtained. Subsequently, the FFAs in APOSS were converted to biodiesel via esterification, catalyzed by immobilized alginate-polyvinyl alcohol (ALG-PVA) lipase. The key factors affecting the reaction, such as the temperature (30–50 °C), methanol to FFA molar ratio (2:1 to 4:1), and agitation rate (150–250 rpm) were optimized by statistical response surface methodology (RSM). The highest biodiesel yield was achieved with a reaction temperature of 40 °C, methanol/FFA molar ratio of 3:1, and 200 rpm agitation rate, as the optimal conditions. Furthermore, the biocatalyst can be reused up to 16 cycles.

In this study, groundnut shell (GNS) was processed at 500 °C in an inert gas atmosphere with a gas flow rate and a heating rate of 10 mL/min and 10 °C/min, respectively, in a custom-designed fluidized bed pyrolytic-reactor. Under optimal operating conditions, the GNS-derived pyrolytic-oil yield was 62.8 wt.%, with the corresponding biochar (19.5 wt.%) and biogas yields (17.7 wt.%). The GC-MS analysis of the GNS-based bio-oil confirmed the presence of (trifluoromethyl)pyridin-2-amine (18.814%), 2-Fluoroformyl-3,3,4,4-tetrafluoro-1,2-oxazetidine (16.23%), 5,7-dimethyl-1H-Indazole (11.613%), N-methyl-N-nitropropan-2-amine (6.5%) and butyl piperidino sulfone (5.668%) as major components, which are used as building blocks in the biofuel, pharmaceutical, and food industries. Furthermore, a 2 × 5 × 1 artificial neural network (ANN) architecture was developed to predict the decomposition behavior of GNS at heating rates of 5, 10, and 20 °C/min, while the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters were estimated using a non-isothermal model-free method. The Popescu method predicted activation energy (Ea) of GNS biomass ranging from 111 kJ/mol to 260 kJ/mol, with changes in enthalpy (ΔH), Gibbs-free energy (ΔG), and entropy (ΔS) ranging from 106 to 254 kJ/mol, 162–241 kJ/mol, and −0.0937 to 0.0598 kJ/mol/K, respectively. The extraction of high-quality precursors from GNS pyrolysis was demonstrated in this study, as well as the usefulness of the ANN technique for thermogravimetric analysis of biomass. © Elsevier Ltd","Artificial neural network; Bio-oil; Characterization; Groundnut shell; Popescu method; Pyrolysis","Activation energy; Biomass; Flow of gases; Fluidized beds; Free energy; Gibbs free energy; Heating rate; Pyrolysis; Quality control; Thermogravimetric analysis; Artificial neural network models; Bio-oils; Characterization; Groundnut shells; Neural-networks; Popescu method; Product distributions; Pyrolysis products; Thermo dynamic analysis; Valorisation; Neural networks; biofuel; biogas; carbon; inert gas; activation energy; artificial neural network; biochar; biomass; enthalpy; pyrolysis; valorization; Article; artificial neural network; atmosphere; biomass; chemical structure; decomposition; enthalpy; entropy; flow rate; food industry; gas flow; kinetic parameters; kinetics; mass fragmentography; peanut; pharmaceutical engineering; physical chemistry; predictive value; pyrolysis; thermodynamics; thermogravimetry; valorization; kinetics; thermodynamics; Biomass; Kinetics; Neural Networks, Computer; Pyrolysis; Thermodynamics; Thermogravimetry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109526088

The main effects of the process parameters were investigated at three levels, and their empirical relationship was modeled using artificial neural network (ANN) and response surface methodology (RSM). The developed models predicted the process behavior with excellent accuracy. Although both models had similar prediction performances, ANN marginally outperformed RSM. The capability of the genetic algorithm (GA) combined with the RSM (RSM-GA) and ANN (ANN-GA) models was evaluated for optimizing the process variables. The maximum biodiesel yield (21.45% w/w) was obtained using the ANN-GA model under optimized conditions, i.e., at the reaction time of 39.69 min, H2SO4 concentration of 3.34% (v/v), methanol-to-sludge relative content of 14.91:1 (mL/g), and ultrasound power of 104.87 W. Consequently, a combination of ANN and GA was proposed to model and optimize the transesterification process. The biodiesel yield obtained in this study was higher than the previously reported values from tannery (10.98%), dairy (13.46%), and municipal (18.58%) sewage sludge.

The investigations are carried out for all activities and operations from jojoba farming, through oil extraction to biodiesel production and byproduct utilization. A thousand-hectare farm, in the eastern Badia of Jordan planted with 1666 jojoba trees per hectare, is selected as a case study area. Over the 20 years life of the project, an average annual seed production of 2.5 kg per tree, with oil content of 50%, is assumed. The amount of biodiesel produced is predicted at 1750.62 tons/year. The total fixed cost and annual operating cost are estimated at US$ thousand 12701.36 and US$ thousand 2352.38, respectively.

In the present study, our focus is on hybrid blends of oil generated, karanja biodiesel and diesel. One of the major problems with biofuel is the lower calorific value, but pyrolysis oil has higher calorific value. Hence the decision was made to blend karanja biodiesel and pyrolysis oil. The blends prepared are tyre pyrolysis (TP) 10%, karanja biodiesel (KB) 20% and diesel 70% called as TP10KB20. Similarly, TP20KB10 was also done. Further, equivalent blends of individual fuel source (TPO30 and KB30) are done and compared. Experimental investigation of hybrid blends (TP10KB20, TP20KB10) and equivalent source blend (TPO30, KBD30 and diesel) fuel are done on single cylinder CI engine. It was observed that performance and combustion of TP10KB20 and TP20KB10 were superior than any other individual blend and diesel. However, emission of TP20KB10 limits it use.

Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) refers collectively to a series of important biorefinery processes to produce biofuels. Here, well-dispersed and ultra-small Ru metal nanoclusters (ca. 1 nm), confined within the micropores of zeolite Y, provide the required active site intimacy, which significantly boosts the chemoselectivity towards the production of pentanoic biofuels in the direct, one-pot HDO of neat ethyl levulinate. Crucial for improving catalyst stability is the addition of La, which upholds the confined proximity by preventing zeolite lattice deconstruction during catalysis. We have established and extended an understanding of the “intimacy criterion” in catalytic biomass valorization.

The synthesis of GVL from renewable biomass and its derivatives has great application prospects but also presents challenges due to the multiple conversion steps involved. Here, a HfCl4-mediated acid-base bifunctional catalytic system was developed, which was demonstrated to be efficient for upgrading furfural (FF) to GVL in a single pot with unprecedented performance. The Lewis acidity of Hf4+ and moderate basicity of HfO(OH)2·xH2O, and strong Brønsted acidity of HCl in situ generated from HfCl4 hydrolysis were found to play a synergistic role in the cascade reaction processes, mainly contributing to the pronounced catalytic activity. The effects of the key reaction parameters, such as the catalyst dosage, reaction time, and temperature, on GVL production were optimized by response surface methodology. It is worth mentioning that the recovered catalyst after thermal treatment could be directly used for the hydrogen transfer processes, like FF-to-furfuryl alcohol conversion. This catalytic strategy opens a new avenue for the selective conversion of biomass feedstocks involving multiple steps and complex processes. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Aldehydes; Biomass; Biopolymers; Bromine compounds; Catalyst activity; Furfural; Acid base; Application prospect; Bi-functional; Bifunctional catalysis; Bio-based; Catalytic system; Lewis acidity; Performance; Platform molecules; ]+ catalyst; Chlorine compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119855188

Biofuel (bio-aviation and biodiesel) is a potential and plausible alternative to diesel fuel to substantially mitigate the environmental impact of future energy demand. Non-edible crop oil is viewed as a potential feedstock for liquid biofuel production owing to the massive demand for edible oil as a food source. However, the major limitation of utilizing non-edible crop oil for biodiesel production is the cost due to the high price of feedstocks and the limited supply of large-scale biodiesel production. Candlenut trees can grow in harsh and arid climates due to low moisture requirements. Therefore, candlenut can be cultivated in the most unused lands, particularly in developing countries along coasts and riverbanks and in deserts and other wastelands unsuitable for edible crops. Additionally, candlenut seed contains a high amount of oil (30%-60%). Thus, candlenut oil is a promising source for commercial biodiesel production. The present study was conducted to review the possibilities and challenges of utilizing candlenut as a potential feedstock for biodiesel production. Additionally, several important aspects related to candlenut oil processing, such as extraction technology, physicochemical properties, biodiesel production technologies, and advantages and limitations of candlenut biodiesel production are discussed. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","bio-aviation; biodiesel; biofuel policy; candlenut oil; economic feasibility; engine performance; oil extraction technology; transesterification","Arid regions; Crops; Crude oil price; Developing countries; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Energy management; Feedstocks; Liquids; Oils and fats; Petroleum industry; Petroleum prospecting; Physicochemical properties; River pollution; As extraction; Biodiesel production; Energy demands; Environmental pollutions; Future energies; Liquid biofuels; Oil processing; Potential feedstock; Biodiesel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099738194

However, residual rice husk ash (RHA) from burning RH is difficult to dispose and causes a serious environment threat. In this study, high-value utility of RHA in terms of form-stable phase change materials (PCMs) was pointed out. RHA was introduced as a supporting material to encapsulate paraffin (PA) to solve the leakage of PA. In order to enhance heat storage capacity, the two-step method was proposed via a neutralization reaction and chemically hydrophobic grafting process to construct a unique RHA nanoporous structure with high adsorptivity of PA. The influence and mechanism of the surface structure and chemical properties of an RHA support on hydrophobicity were deeply discussed, in which the surface chemical structures and fractal characteristics were revealed. The results indicated that PA/bio-based RHA composites possessed enhanced enthalpies due to the synergism of pore structure enlargement and surface hydrophobization of the RHA support. Furthermore, the composite PCM showed excellent solar-to-thermal conversion and thermal cycling reliability. This work provides a new insight into the high value utilization of biomass waste RHA and the development of high performance and multifunction for PA/bio-based RHA phase change composites. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,"Grafting (chemical); Hydrophobicity; Phase change materials; Pore structure; Surface structure; Bio-based; Form stable phase change material; Functionalized; Heat storage capacity; Phase Change; Recyclables; Rice husk; Rice-husk ash; Thermal conversion; Ultra-fast; Heat storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115616196

At the present time, biodiesel is largely produced by acid or alkali transesterification reactions. A hot spring water algae isolate “Kamptonema formosum” was cultivated at three different temperatures, and the algae oil was extracted using chloroform and methanol (v/v, 1/1 ratio) as the solvent. The maximum amount of algal biomass (1.86 g/L) was obtained at 25°C, and the extracted oil was found to be 48.7% of the total dry biomass. Diatomic earth particles (Biosilica) were magnetized via thermal co-precipitation reaction, and then it was grafted with polydopamine (MBioSi@PDA). The lipase was covalently immobilized on the surface of the MBioSi@PDA via Schiff’s base reaction. The immobilization conditions were optimized and 3.0 mg/mL as the initial lipase concentration in the immobilization medium was found to be the most favorable. At this lipase concentration, the amount of the immobilized lipase on the MBioSi@PDA particles and immobilization yield were found to be 81.9 mg/g and 67.9%, respectively. The MBioSi@PDA@lipase particles were used for conversion of K. formosum oil into biodiesel, and the conversion yield was found as 91.2% under optimum conditions.

The problem is that the world is running out of fossil fuel. Therefore, an alternative source must be identified. The biofuels are promising alternatives. In the case of petrodiesel, a promising alternative is biodiesel production from algae. The ability of microalgae to generate large quantities of lipids with a fast growth rate made them superior biodiesel producers. Using light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as an energy source in microalgal cultivation was recently increased owing to its large spectrum, endurance, and low-energy utilization. Changes in cultivation conditions, limited capabilities of harvesting light, and self-shading of microalgae were the most important problems. Therefore, the photobiostimulation of algae using LEDs radiation led to an increase in algal growth rate which results in increased lipid production. This research investigated the influence of monochromatic LEDs on the growth of Chlorella sorokiniana microalga. At the first phase, microalgae growth and algal biomass significantly increased under red LEDs [2.3 g/L], blue LEDs [1.8 g/L], green LEDs [0.7 g/L], and white LEDs (0.6) g/L as a control, respectively. At the second phase, microalgal growth and algal biomass significantly increased under red LEDs [2.9 g/L], blue LEDs 2.3 g/L, and white LEDs (1.5) g/L as a control, respectively. The percentage of extracted oil (%) or the yield of extracted oil of microalgae was 10.38 % (white LEDs), 16.94 % (blue LEDs), and 15.55 % (red LEDs) respectively. It was concluded that the photobiostimulation of algae using LEDs led to the enhanced weight of algal biomass, therefore increased of lipids and biodiesel production. The red LEDs were the best one in terms of increasing the weight of algal biomass. The blue LEDs were the best one in terms of increasing the percentage of extracted oil. However, the green LEDs were not effective. ©2021 National Information and Documentation Center (NIDOC)","Biodiesel; Biofuels; Light emitting diodes; Microalgae; Photobioreactor; Photobiostimulation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115974935

The following techniques were used to characterise the synthesised catalysts: X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Temperature Programmed Desorption (CO2-TPD). The synthesised catalyst revealed its suitability for transesterification to produce biodiesel. The biodiesel production process was optimised, and it showed that the optimal biodiesel yield is 93.59%. The optimal set of process parameters is process temperature 80◦C, process time 90 min, methanol-to-oil molar ratio 8 and catalyst loading 3 wt.%. It has been found that the high basicity of the catalyst tends to give a high biodiesel yield at low methanol-to-oil ratio 8 when the reaction time is also less (90 min). The fuel properties of biodiesel also satisfied the standard limits defined by ASTM and the EN standards. Thus, the synthesised catalyst from waste eggshells is highly active, improved the biodiesel production conditions and PPSS oil is a potential nonedible source. © 2021 by the author.

Biobased fuels developed have been shown to easily blend in with the existing automobile engines and to provide sustainable performance. Similarly, the usage of various biobased polymers, plastics, and composite materials as the structural materials for the construction of automobiles instead of crude oil sources have shown to be invaluable. The powering of automobiles with electricity is the future of the transportation industry to address the greenhouse gas emissions caused by fossil fuels. Hence, biobased lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors have started to enter the mid-sized automotive industry. However, extensive commercialization of biobased products application in the automotive sector is underdeveloped. Hence it is customary to assess the various drawbacks of using biobased materials and identify the correct pathway for new research and development in this field.

The waste algal biomass obtained after phycoremediation, which may contain residual hazardous materials, could still be used as feedstock to produce biofuels/bioenergy preferably through thermochemical conversion technology. This review proposes a synergistic approach by utilizing the phycoremediation-derived algal biomass (PCDA) as feedstock for efficient hazardous waste treatment and clean energy generation via supercritical water gasification (SCWG). The review provides an in-depth study of catalytic, non-catalytic, and continuous SCWG of algal biomass, aiming to lay out the foundations for future study. In addition, the concepts of heat integration as well as water, nutrient, and CO2 recycling were introduced for a sustainable algae-to-biofuel process, which significantly enhances the overall energy and material efficiency of SCWG. The production of biofuel from algal biomass via other advanced gasification technologies, such as integration with other thermochemical conversion techniques, co-gasification, chemical looping gasification (CLG), and integrated gasification and combined cycle (IGCC) were also discussed.

In the past few years, POPs have garnered colossal research interest as nanoreactors for heterogeneous catalysis (thermal, photochemical, electrochemical, etc.) because of their intriguing characteristic features, such as high thermal and chemical stabilities, adjustable chemical functionalities, large surface areas, and tunable pore size distributions. This feature article provides an overview of existing research relating to diverse POP synthetic approaches (COFs, CTFs, and some amorphous POPs), the possible modification of the functionality of POPs, and their exciting application as next-generation nanoreactors. These POPs are extremely interesting, as they offer the potential for either metal-free or metalated polymer catalysts allowing photocatalytic CO2 reduction to solar-fuel, biofuel upgrades, the conversion of waste cooking oil to bio-oil, and clean H2 production from water, addressing many scientific and technological challenges and providing new opportunities for various specific topics in catalysis. Finally, we emphasize that the integration of various synthetic approaches and the application of POPs as nanoreactors will provide opportunities in the near future for the precision synthesis of functional materials with significant impact in both basic and applied research areas.

In this review, the physical and chemical properties of WCO are evaluated along with its regulations and policies in different countries to promote WCO refined biofuels. Blended WCO can be an auxiliary fuel for municipal solid waste incinerators while the heat produced is able to form superheated steam and subsequently generate electricity via combined heat and power system. Also, WCO contains high ratio of hydrogen atoms compared to carbon and oxygen atoms, making it able to be catalytically cracked, synthesizing hydrogen gas. WCO-based biodiesel has been traditionally produced by transesterification in order to substitute petroleum-based diesel which has non-degradability as well as non-renewable features. Hence, the potentials of hazardous WCO as a green alternative energy source for electricity generation, hydrogen gas as well as biofuels production (e.g. biodiesel, biogas, biojet fuel) are critically discussed due to its attractive psychochemical properties as well as its economic feasibility.

To attain this aim, using biomass as an alternative resource for diesel production has been a hotspot among researchers. Biodiesel has several advantages, such as being lower toxic and more renewable, and eco-friendlier than diesel from fossil fuel resources. Several edible and non-edible bio-sources were used for the production of biodiesel from the transesterification process. Algal oil as a non-edible source is considered an abundant, low cost and green substrate for biodiesel production. Various factors such as reaction conditions and the type of catalyst affect the biodiesel production process. Different catalytic systems such as basic and acidic homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts and biocatalysts were introduced for the process in the literature, and each proposed catalyst has its own advantages and disadvantages. For instance, in spite of the lower cost and better mass transfer of base and acid homogeneous catalysts, reaction system corrosion, non-reusability, and soap formation are serious challenges of these catalysts at an industrial scale. On the other hand, acid and base heterogenous catalysts overcame the issues of corrosion and recovery, but some matters such as mass transfer limitation, high cost, and weak performance in catalyzing both esterification of FFAs and transesterification of lipids must be taken into account. In addition, bio-catalysis as a high-cost process led to a purer product formation with less side reaction. Therefore, several significant factors should be considered for transesterification catalysts such as availability, cost, reusability, stability, mass transfer, and the possibility to manage both the transesterification of triglycerides and the esterification of FFAs, selecting a catalyst with predominant pros is viable. Here, a review of the biodiesel production from algal biomass focusing on the efficient catalyst of the process is presented. © 2021 by the authors.

The development of highly active and stable noble metal-free ORR electrocatalysts remains as one of major challenges. Herein, we report cobalt/nitrogen co-doped porous carbon materials (Co-N-C) originated from well-designed bimetal-organic frameworks (Zn100-xCox-ZIF) as efficient ORR electrocatalysts in both pH-neutral and alkaline solutions. The compositional and structural features, and the corresponding ORR activity can be tailored by tuning the Zn/Co ratio in the precursor. Remarkable features of large surface-area and suitable graphitization degree and well-dispersed Co-N-C moieties, enable a high catalytic efficiency. The optimized electrocatalyst registers considerable ORR performance with a high half-wave potential of 0.65 V vs RHE and a saturated current density of 5.30 mA cm−2 close to the value of the commercial Pt/C in 0.1 M pH 7.0 PBS, along with considerable operational stability and tolerance to glucose. A preliminary one-compartment hybrid glucose/O2 enzymatic biofuel cell, consisting of the Co-N-C-10 abiotic cathode and a glucose oxidizing bioanode, is constructed and tested. Furthermore, Co-N-C presents reasonable ORR electrocatalytic activity and operational stability in alkaline condition. © 2021","Cobalt and nitrogen-doped porous carbon; Electron transfer; Metal-organic frameworks; Neutral solution; Oxygen reduction reaction","Alkalinity; Biofuels; Carbon; Cobalt; Electrocatalysts; Electrolytic reduction; Fuel cells; Glucose; Organometallics; Oxygen; Porous materials; Precious metals; Cobalt and nitrogen-doped porous carbon; Electrochemical oxygen reduction; Electron transfer; Metal-organic-frameworks; Neutral solution; Nitrogen-doped; Operational stability; Oxygen reduction reaction; Porous carbons; ]+ catalyst; Doping (additives)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111053973

Recently, highly productive crops, such as sugarcane and energycane, have been engineered to accumulate triacylglycerides (TAGs) that allow the production of far more industrial vegetable oil than previously possible. A proof-of-concept suggests that biodiesel production from engineered energycane will be possible. However, before making efforts for scale-up, it is critical to understand the commercial feasibility and economic competitiveness of this process. This study performs techno-economic analysis of a unique biorefinery processing energycane to co-produce biodiesel and ethanol. Comprehensive process simulation models were developed for two scenarios: (i) biodiesel from TAGs and ethanol from fermentation of sugars in juice and (ii) biodiesel from TAGs and ethanol from fermentation of sugars in juice and hydrolysis of carbohydrates in bagasse. Based on the target levels, the analysis was performed for energycane containing 0%, 5%, and 7.7% TAGs (d.b.). The biodiesel from engineered energycane was found economically viable and competitive to soybean biodiesel. Although the capital investment is higher compared to the soybean biodiesel plant, the biodiesel production costs ($0.66–$0.9/L) were lower than soybean biodiesel ($0.91/L). Biorefinery-scenario-1 processing energycane containing 7.7% TAG produces biodiesel with profitability (IRR 7.84) slightly lower than soybean biodiesel (IRR 8.3), but yields five times of biodiesel per unit land and is self-sustainable for energy requirements. The surplus electricity can displace fossil electricity and provide environmental benefits. Monte Carlo simulation indicated that biorefinery is profitable with a 29%–65% probability (NPV > 0) which is largely controlled by feedstock composition and biodiesel market price. It is important to note that energycane can be grown on the marginal rainfed lands in S.E. USA, where soybean would not be viable. Biodiesel from engineered energycane would therefore be complementary to soydiesel in the United States. © 2021 The Authors.

One such potential alternative source of fuel is biodiesel. In the light of the search for newer fuels, the present work focuses on Vateria Indica biodiesel that is found widely in Western Ghats of India and Srilanka. The work reports on the extraction of Vateria Indica oil, preparation of its biodiesel and performance testing of biodiesel blends on compression ignition engine (diesel engine). The oil and biodiesel yields have been optimized by Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and are found to be 23% and 85% respectively. The performance test results of Vateria Indica biodiesel blends on diesel engine have indicated that the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) was found to be lower and the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) was found to be higher for B10 (90% diesel+10% biodiesel), B20 (80% diesel+20% biodiesel) and B30 (70% diesel+30% biodiesel) blends compared to neat diesel. The performance characteristics of B10 blend were very close to neat diesel. The combustion characteristics of biodiesel blends were found to be superior compared to neat diesel. The B30 blend has better combustion characteristics compared to B10 and B20 blends. The emissions of unburnt hydrocarbons (UBHC), carbon monoxide (CO) and smoke were lower, and oxides of nitrogen (NOX) were higher for all the blends of biodiesel compared to neat diesel. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Diesel engine; Emissions; Transesterification; Vateria Indica oil","biodiesel; carbon monoxide; hydrocarbon; nitrogen oxide; Article; biofuel production; combustion; diesel engine; Dipterocarpaceae; esterification; India; nonhuman; performance; plant seed; response surface method; Sri Lanka; transesterification; Vateria indica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108012479

The Z/GP composite as catalyst was applied in the transesterification of SCO according to suggested experiment conditions from statistical design which was built based on the Response Surface Methodology. The measured biodiesel yield from SCO over Z/GP catalyst is 98.1% at experimental conditions of 40 °C as temperature, 90 min as time, 12:1 as methanol/SCO ratio, and 3.25 wt, % as Z/GP loading value.

The optimum biodiesel yield was obtained as 92% by undergoing microwave transesterification with 20 min time, 4.5 wt% catalyst amount and 1:12 oil-methanol ratio at 55 °C. The activation energy needed for the reaction was 51.9 kJ/mol. The thermodynamic parameters for the transesterification process, such as enthalpy and entropy were 56.4 kJ/mol and −0.091 kJ/mol. Further, the engine studies were carried out for different fuel injection pressures and injection timing. Performance results reveal that BSEC and BTE of biodiesel are lower and higher than that of diesel fuel for 400 bar FIP and 27° CA bTDC FIT at full load respectively. However, except NO, composite emissions of CO, UBHC and dry soot are comparatively lesser than that of standard emission norms. It is thereby inferred from the experimental results that the optimum fuel injection pressure and timing are 400 bar and 27° CA bTDC.

The catalyst was examined for the conversion of novel Brachychiton populneus seed oil (BPSO) into biodiesel. The Brachychiton populneus seeds have a higher oil content (41 wt%) and free fatty acid value (3.8 mg KOH/g). The synthesised green nanocatalyst was examined by the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, energy dispersive X-Ray (EDX) spectroscopy, X-Ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The obtained results show that the synthesised green nanocatalyst was 22–26 nm in diameter and spherical-cubic in shape with a higher rate of catalytic efficiency. It was utilised further for the conversion of BPSO into biofuel. Due to the high free fatty acid value, the biodiesel was synthesised by the two-step process, i.e., pretreatment of the BPSO by means of acid esterification and then followed by the transesterification reaction. The acidic catalyst (H2SO4) was used for the pretreatment of BPSO. The optimum condition for the transesterification of the pretreated BPSO was 1:9 of oil-methanol molar ratio, 2.5 wt % of prepared nanocatalyst concentration and 85 °C of reaction temperature corresponding to the highest biodiesel yield of 97.5 wt%. The synthesised biodiesel was analysed by the FT-IR and GC-MS technique to determine the chemical composition of fatty acid methyl esters. Fuel properties of Brachychiton populneus seed oil biodiesel (BPSOB) were also examined, compared, and it falls in the prescribed range of ASTM standards. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiesel; Brachychiton populneus seed oil; Green NiO nanocatalyst; Latex extract; Pretreatment","ASTM standards; Esters; Fatty acids; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Mass spectrometry; Molar ratio; Nanocatalysts; Nickel oxide; Oils and fats; Potassium hydroxide; Scanning electron microscopy; Transesterification; Acid value; Brachychiton populneu seed oil; Fourier transform infra reds; Green NiO nanocatalyst; Latex extract; Nano-catalyst; Parametric study; Pre-treatments; Seed oil; Synthesised; Biodiesel; biodiesel; fatty acid; fatty acid ester; Ficus elastic extract; metal oxide; nickel; nickel oxide; plant extract; unclassified drug; vegetable oil; biofuel; nickel monoxide; angiosperm; biofuel; catalysis; catalyst; chemical composition; ester; gas chromatography; mass spectrometry; reaction kinetics; Article; biofuel production; Brachychiton populneus; chemical composition; controlled study; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; esterification; Ficus; Ficus elastic; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; green chemistry; Malvaceae; mass fragmentography; nanocatalyst; plant seed; process optimization; reaction temperature; scanning electron microscopy; transesterification; X ray diffraction; catalysis; infrared spectroscopy; Brachychiton populneus; Ficus ficus; Biofuels; Catalysis; Esterification; Nickel; Plant Oils; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103752571

However, slow intermediate desorption and low selectivity limit its implementation. Identifying the catalytic performance of each active sites is vital to design hydrogenation catalyst, and tuning the geometrical sites at molecule level in PtNi could lead to the modification of electronic structure, and thus the selectity for the hydrogenation of FAL was modulated. Herein, PtNi hollow nanoframes (PtNi HNFs) with three dimensional (3D) molecular accessibility were synthesized, EDX results suggested that Ni was evenly distributed inside of the hollow nanoframes, whereas Pt was relatively concentrated at the edges. DFT calculation demonstrated that PtNi significant decrease the desorption energy of the intermediates. This strategy could not only enhance the desorption of intermediates to improve the catalytic performance, but also transfer the adsorption mode of FAL on catalyst surface to selective hydrogenation of FAL to FOL or THFA. The PtNi HNFs catalyst afforded excellent catalytic performance for selective hydrogenation of a broad range of biomass-derived platform chemicals under mild conditions, especially of FAL to furfuryl alcohol (FOL), in quantitative FOL yields (99%) with a high TOF of 2.56 h−1. It is found that the superior performance of PtNi HNFs is attributed to its 3D hierarchical structure and synergistic electronic effects between Pt and Ni. Besides, the kinetic study demonstrated that the activation energy for hydrogenation of FAL was as low as 54.95 kJ mol−1. © 2021 Science Press","Biofuels; Biomass; Heterogeneous catalysts; Hydrogenation; PtNi HNFs","Activation energy; Binary alloys; Catalyst activity; Design for testability; Desorption; Electronic structure; Hydrogenation; Platinum; Platinum alloys; Bimetallic surfaces; Catalytic performance; Hierarchical structures; High-value chemicals; Hydrogenation catalyst; Selective catalytic hydrogenations; Selective hydrogenation; Threedimensional (3-d); Nickel metallography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099363659

In this regard, tuning the oxophilic property of catalysts can significantly impact their activity and selectivities to target deoxygenated products in the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of lignin-derived phenolics. Herein, MoOx-decorated bimetallic Ni-Mo catalysts with a unique hierarchical flower-like micro/nanostructure were fabricated via a facile dopamine-assisted hydrothermal approach and adopted in the HDO of guaiacol to produce cyclohexane. By adjusting the content of Mo species, the bimetallic Ni-Mo catalyst with a Mo/Ni molar ratio of 0.1 exhibited a superior catalytic HDO performance to the Mo-free one, as well as Al2O3-supported Ni and bimetallic Ni-Mo ones prepared by the impregnation method. Combining various comprehensive structural characterization methods and catalytic HDO tests with density functional theory calculations, it was unveiled that surface defective MoOx species in the vicinity of metallic sites could greatly promote the demethoxylation of guaiacol or reaction intermediates, while Ni-Mo alloy sites could promote the dehydroxylation of cyclohexanol intermediates. Therefore, a perfect catalytic cooperative effect between Ni-Mo alloy sites and defective MoOx structures played crucial roles in accelerating the demethoxylation and dehydroxylation processes in the HDO of guaiacol. The present surface defect-bimetal engineering approach provides a promising guide for constructing highly efficient bimetallic catalysts for the upgrading of biomass-derived phenolics. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","defective structure; hydrodeoxygenation; Ni-Mo alloy sites; oxophilicity; surface cooperative effect","Alcohols; Alumina; Aluminum alloys; Aluminum oxide; Amines; Binary alloys; Catalysts; Density functional theory; Molar ratio; Molybdenum oxide; Nickel alloys; Precious metals; Reaction intermediates; Surface defects; Bimetallic catalysts; Co-operative effects; Defective structures; Hydrodeoxygenation; Impregnation methods; Micro/nanostructures; Non-noble metal catalysts; Structural characterization; Molybdenum alloys; Alcohols; Alloy; Aluminum Oxide; Amines; Catalysts; Guaiacol; Precious Metals; Sites",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114333157

Herein, metal-organic framework (MOF)-encapsulating metal-acid interfaces (Pd@UiO-CH2SO3H, Pd@UiO-PhSO3H) were first reported. Compared with traditionally supported catalysts (Pd/UiO-SO3H, Pd/UiO-NH2), Pd-acid-interface-encapsulated MOFs show much higher activity and selectivity for MF to 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF), HMF to DMF, and VA to 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol (MMP) reactions. In particular, Pd@UiO-SO3H shows the best catalytic performance with 89.0 and 86.0% DMF yield from MF and HMF and a 99.4% MMP yield from VA based on its suitable hydrophilicity, high hydrogen activation ability, and abundant Pd-SO3H interface active sites. According to the catalytic performance of Pd/UiO-NH2 and the results of an ATR-IR test, the acidic sites on the Pd-acid interface can accelerate the activation of the hydroxyl group for these hydrogenolysis reactions. This work provides an effective design strategy for the preparation of MOF-encapsulating metal-acid interfaces and shows the powerful synergistic effect of hydrogenation and acid catalysis. ©","Adsorption configuration; Aromatic aldehydes; C-O hydrogenolysis; C=O hydrogenation; Pd@UiO-SO3H","Aldehydes; Catalyst selectivity; Chemical activation; Hydrogenolysis; Hydrolysis; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Metals; Organometallics; 5 hydroxymethyl furfurals; Catalytic hydrogenolysis; Catalytic performance; Design strategies; Hydrogen activation; Hydrogenolysis reactions; Selective catalysts; Synergistic effect; Palladium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113747478

Agricultural and forestry wastes are important parts of China's energy, and their high-grade utilization is useful to solve the problem of energy shortages and environmental pollution. To the best of our knowledge, the impact of nanocatalysts on converting biowastes for bio-oil has not been studied. Consequently, we examined the production of bio-oil by pyrolysis of Aesculus chinensis Bunge Seed (ACBS) using nanocatalysts (Fe2O3 and NiO catalysts) for the first time. The pyrolysis products of ACBS include 1-hydroxy-2-propanone (3.97%), acetic acid (5.42%), and furfural (0.66%). These chemical components can be recovered for use as chemical feedstock in the form of bio-oil, thus indicating the potential of ACBS as a feedstock to be converted by pyrolysis to produce value-added bio-oil. The Fe2O3 and NiO catalysts enhanced the pyrolysis process, which accelerated the precipitation of gaseous products.

Counties are exploring different alternative energy sources that can be sustainable and locally available. Waste-based biofuel, i.e., biodiesel, can be an excellent cheap alternative to diminish the fuel supply–demand conflict and can also play an important role in mitigating the adverse effects of greenhouse gas emissions in the environment. This study focuses on four biodiesel feedstocks that are classified as having the most potential (microalgae oil), being the most prevalent (palm oil), the most popular (soybean oil), and the most proven (coconut oil) identified by the current researchers. The Scopus research database recognises these biodiesel feedstocks. The ranking among these studied biodiesel feedstocks is focused on technical, economic, environmental, and social aspects with eighteen criteria. There are five weighting methods used in this study, namely EQUAL, Criteria importance through intercriteria correlation (CRITIC), ENTROPY, Analytical hierarchical process (AHP), and Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchical Process (FAHP). Five multiple criteria decision analysis processes, namely PROMETHEE, Weighted sum method (WSM), Weighted product method (WPM), Technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), and VIse Kriterijumska Optimizacija Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) are applied for ranking these feedstocks. The results reveal that Coconut oil rated the best followed by Microalgae and Palm oil, whereas Soybean was considered to be the worst performer among those feedstocks.

This process produced partially hydrogenated fatty acid methyl esters (H-FAME) as a new type of high-quality biodiesel fuel enriched in monounsaturated fatty acid methyl esters (mono-FAME), which is a potential source for formulating high blends of biodiesel fuel with petrodiesel. MCM-41 supports with various structural properties and morphologies were synthesized by self-assembly with different amounts of ammonia solution as a mineralizing agent. Bimetallic Pd-Pt nanoparticles with a Pd/Pt atomic ratio of 4 were stepwise impregnated on three MCM-41 supports, resulting in a series of Pd-Pt/MCM-41 bimetallic catalysts with tunable porosity (0.89–1.79 cm3 g−1), average pore size (3.2–8.5 nm), and particle size (0.12–0.62 μm). The Pd-Pt/MCM-41 catalyst prepared with the least amount of ammonia produced the best partial hydrogenation conversion of polyunsaturated FAME into mono-FAME, ascribed to nano-aggregation resulting in a dual-pore system containing large pores for fast molecular diffusion; a high turnover frequency (1920 h−1), larger k1 rate constant (0.60 gcat−1h−1), and smaller k2 rate constant (0.37 gcat−1h−1) were obtained. Furthermore, this Pd-Pt/MCM-41 catalyst exhibited excellent sulfur resistance in the synthesis of H-FAME, even though the feedstocks contained approximately 5 ppm of sulfur contaminates.

It is attractive to develop new efficient systems for the catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) of levulinate esters to value-added GVL. In this work, a series of MoS2-based supported catalysts were prepared via an impregnation method for the CTH of biomass-derived ethyl levulinate (EL) to GVL. By comprehensive characterization and catalytic measurements, we found that the CTH activity of EL to GVL is closely related to the MoS2 morphology and acid distribution on the support. Among the catalysts with different supports, the AC support with abundant Lewis acid sites and large surface area facilitated the high dispersion of low stacked MoS2 slabs, and the MoS2-acid synergistic catalysis contributed to the superior activity and selectivity. The conversion of EL and the selectivity of GVL reached 97.2% and 91.2% under optimized conditions over the MoS2/AC catalyst (230 °C, 1 MPa H2, 1.5 h), respectively. We also conducted reaction kinetic experiments to reveal the relationship between the active site of the MoS2/AC catalyst and its catalytic performance, and the plausible reaction pathway and mechanism over MoS2/AC was proposed. The catalytic performance gradually declined during recycling tests due to the oxidation of MoS2 and can be easily recovered by resulfuration. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Catalyst activity; Catalyst selectivity; Catalytic oxidation; Esters; Hydrogenation; Layered semiconductors; Molybdenum compounds; Morphology; Reaction kinetics; Acid distribution; Catalytic performance; Catalytic transfer hydrogenation; Impregnation methods; Kinetic experiment; Large surface area; Optimized conditions; Synergistic catalysis; Catalyst supports; Acids; Anatomy; Biomass; Esters; Hydrogenation; Molybdenum Compounds; Performance; Reaction Kinetics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112367073

However, the use of this raw material tends to have limitations regarding long-term availability. Thus, the study of different raw materials for the production of renewable fuels is of great importance. The present study had as objective the production of biodiesel from corn and the study of the physicochemical characteristics of the diesel-biodiesel mixtures in the proportions of 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80 % and 90%. Biodiesel was produced by methyl route, using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) as a catalyst. The transesterification took place under magnetic stirring, respecting the proportion of 6 moles of methyl alcohol to 1 mole of vegetable oil, 1% of NaOH in volumetric basis and stirring time of 60 minutes. An increase in specific mass and kinematic viscosity was observed in relation to the proportion of biodiesel in the blends. The results indicated that the production of biodiesel from corn oil had a satisfactory average yield of 94.29% and that only the diesel-biodiesel blends B10, B20, B30, B40 and B50 presented specific mass and kinematic viscosity in patterns consistent with the norm. © 2021 University Center of Maringa.

Here, we attempted to meet these requirements by using concurrently microhole-structured meshes as (i) a membrane for the gas diffusion extraction of an analyte from a donor sample and (ii) an electrode for the sensitive electrochemical determination of this target with the receptor electrolyte at rest. We used two types of meshes with complementary benefits, i.e., Ni mesh fabricated by robust, scalable, and well-established methods for manufacturing specific designs and stainless steel wire mesh (SSWM), which is commercially available at a low cost. The diffusion of gas (from a donor) was conducted in headspace mode, thus minimizing issues related to mesh fouling. When compared with the conventional polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane, both the meshes (40 μm hole diameter) led to a higher amount of vapor collected into the electrolyte for subsequent detection. This inedited fashion produced a kind of reverse diffusion of the analyte dissolved into the electrolyte (receptor), i.e., from the electrode to bulk, which further enabled highly sensitive analyses. Using Ni mesh coated with Ni(OH)2 nanoparticles, the limit of detection reached for ethanol was 24-fold lower than the data attained by a platform with a PTFE membrane and placement of the electrode into electrolyte bulk. This system was applied in the determination of ethanol in complex samples related to the production of ethanol biofuel. It is noteworthy that a simple equation fitted by machine learning was able to provide accurate assays (accuracies from 97 to 102%) by overcoming matrix effect-related interferences on detection performance. Furthermore, preliminary measurements demonstrated the successful coating of the meshes with gold films as an alternative raw electrode material and the monitoring of HCl utilizing Au-coated SSWMs. These strategies extend the applicability of the platform that may help to develop valuable volatile sensing solutions. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","ethanol; flexible electrode; machine learning; toxic gas; VOCs","Chemical detection; Chlorine compounds; Costs; Diffusion in gases; Electrolytes; Ethanol; Gold coatings; Gold compounds; Mesh generation; Polytetrafluoroethylenes; Volatile organic compounds; Detection performance; Electrochemical determination; Electrode material; Limit of detection; Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE); Semi-permeable membranes; Stainless steel wire meshes; Volatile compounds; Electrochemical electrodes; alcohol; hydrochloric acid; hydroxide; metal nanoparticle; nickel; nickel hydroxide (II); stainless steel; volatile organic compound; artificial membrane; chemistry; devices; electrochemical analysis; electrode; limit of detection; procedures; Electrochemical Techniques; Electrodes; Ethanol; Hydrochloric Acid; Hydroxides; Limit of Detection; Membranes, Artificial; Metal Nanoparticles; Nickel; Stainless Steel; Volatile Organic Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112528647

It was observed that the removal of the toxic compound could be achieved from methane carrier gas using a dielectric barrier discharge reactor, and it depends on plasma input power. The maximum removal of the toxic compound was 85.9% at 40 W and 2.86 s. The major gaseous products were H2 and lower hydrocarbons (LHC) and the yield of these products also increases with input power. In the current study, the yield of gaseous products depends on the decomposition of toxic compounds and methane, because the decomposition of methane also produces H2 and lower hydrocarbons. The percentage yield of H2 increases from 0.43-4.74%. Similarly, the yield of LHC increases from 0.56-7.54% under the same reaction conditions. Hence, input power promoted the decomposition of the toxic compound and enhanced the yield of gaseous products. © 2021 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Biogas; Dielectric materials; Electric discharges; Flow control; Methane; Renewable energy resources; Toluene; Biofuel production; Decomposition of methane; Dielectric barrier discharge reactors; Human health problems; Methane carriers; Nonthermal plasma; Reaction conditions; Renewable energy source; Dielectric devices",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113713800

Six biodiesel samples were divided into two groups based on their fatty acid composition, including group 1 (coconut, castor, and jatropha) and group II (palm, karanja, and waste cooking oil biodiesel). All fuels (in both groups) were tested in a single-cylinder off-road diesel engine. Castor and karanja biodiesel, both rich in mono-unsaturation level, have a high viscosity of about 14.5 and 5.04 mm2/s, respectively. The coconut and palm biodiesels are rich in saturation level with cetane numbers of 62 and 60, respectively. In both groups, highly saturated and poly-unsaturated methyl esters presented better combustion efficiency and less formation of polluted emissions than mono-unsaturation. At full load, coconut and palm biodiesel displayed 38% and 10% advanced start of combustion, respectively, which reduced ignition delay by approximately 10% and 3%, respectively. Mono-unsaturated methyl esters exhibited a higher cylinder pressure and heat release rate, which results in higher NOx gas emissions. The group II biodiesels showed about 10–15% lower exhaust emissions owing to an optimum level of fatty acid composition. Our study concluded that highly saturated and poly-unsaturated fatty acid performed better than mono-unsaturated biodiesels for off-road engine application. © 2021 by the authors.

The regulation of the functional properties of the catalysts was attained by adjusting their nanostructure and reducibility by introducing various types and content of M promoters (M = Pt, Pd, Rh, Re; molar ratio M/Ni = 0.003–0.012). The composition–characteristics–activity correlation was determined using catalyst testing in ATR of C2H5OH, thermal analysis, N2 adsorption, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and EDX analysis. It was shown that the type and content of the promoter, as well as the preparation mode (combined or sequential impregnation methods), determine the redox properties of catalysts and influence the textural and structural characteristics of the samples. The reducibility of catalysts improves in the following sequence of promoters: Re < Rh < Pd < Pt, with an increase in their content, and when using the co-impregnation method. It was found that in ATR of C2H5OH over bimetallic Ni-M/Ce0.8Lа0.2O1.9 catalysts at 600 °C, the hydrogen yield increased in the following row of promoters: Pt < Rh < Pd < Re at 100% conversion of ethanol. The introduction of M leads to the formation of a NiM alloy under reaction conditions and affects the resistance of the catalyst to oxidation, sintering, and coking. It was found that for enhancing Ni catalyst performance in H2 production through ATR of C2H5OH, the most effective promotion is with Re: at 600 °C over the optimum 10Ni-0.4Re/Ce0.8Lа0.2O1.9 catalyst the highest hydrogen yield 65% was observed. © 2021 by the authors.

The biofuel production involves collecting biomass, breaking down cell wall components followed by the conversion of sugars to ethanol. The lingo-cellulosic biomass comprises 40-50% cellulose, 20-30% hemi-cellulose, and 10-25% lignin. Sorghum is a widely adapted energy crop for biofuel production. Biomass with low lignin, high cellulose, and high hemicellulose contents are exploited to attain maximum biofuel production efficiency. Resistance to lodging, pest, disease, and abiotic stresses related to cell wall components is well documented, and quantitative trait loci were identified to understand these traits' genetic correlation. Selection for reduced lignin and in-creased cellulose content in stover can increase the ethanol yield. The Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) is a complementary approach to evaluating the marker and phenotype associations among large diversity panels. Single nucleotide polymorphisms were scanned to identify loci associated with the traits of interest. In this study, the GWAS was performed on 245 sorghum minicore genotypes to analyze agronomic traits (days to 50%flowering, fresh biomass yield, dry biomass yield) and cell wall components (cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin). Further, in-silico validation of the candidate genes was performed in a global gene expression data from large-scale RNA sequencing studies in sorghum available in the NCBI GEO database was used. Objective: The objectives of this study are to evaluate native variations in biofuel related agronomic traits and stalk cell wall components and to identify significant SNPs or loci related to the cell wall components. Methods: In this article, an association mapping panel, comprising of 245 sorghum minicore germplasm accessions, was evaluated during two post rainy seasons of 2013 and 2014, and observations were recorded on the whole plot-for days to 50% flowering, fresh biomass yield (tha-1 ), and dry biomass yield (tha-1 ). The biomass of sun-dried plants from both seasons was collected separately, chopped, dried, and ground to powder. The cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin contents were determined in the powdered. The content of each of these three components in sorghum was expressed in percent of dry matter. The data on agronomic traits and composition analysis was subjected to Analysis of Variance. For the current study, we remapped the raw GBS data with the sorghum assembly version v3.1. A total of 27,589 SNPs were obtained with a minor allele frequency (MAF) &gt;1% and missing data &lt;50%. The GWAS was performed in a single minicore population using FarmCPU, in R software. The synteny positions of the identified significant SNPs between sorghum and other model crop species viz., maize, switchgrass, and Arabidopsis were represented using CIR-COS software for traits viz., dry biomass yield, cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. The transcriptome dataset from where sorghum gene atlas studies of grain, sweet, and bioenergy sorghums are available through NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession number GSE49879, was used to cross-validate the identified SNPs for cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin through GWAS. Results: High broad-sense heritability was exhibited for all the traits in individual seasons along with significant geno-type × environment interaction across seasons except lignin. Association mapping with a P &lt; 1×10−4 revealed genomic regions associated with the-(i) agronomic traits (days to 50% flowering, fresh and dry biomass), and (ii) biochemical traits (cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin) associated with biofuels production, in individual seasons. Twelve significant SNPs for flowering time, 30 fresh biomass yields, and 24 for dry biomass yield, 25 for cellulose, 7 for hemicellu-lose, and 21 for lignin were identified. CIRCOS plot was constructed to identify and analyze similarities and differences while comparing the sorghum genome with different crops. For cellulose high similarity of &gt;80% was observed for all sorghum gene sequences with the maize homologs. The overall similarity of sorghum homologs with foxtail millet was &gt;65%, for Arabidopsis from 30.6% to 48.6%, and rice from 28.2% to 92.8%. SNPs for hemicellulose displayed maximum similarity to foxtail millet followed by maize. The sequence similarity of lignin SNPs in sorghum was high-est with the maize genome followed by Arabidopsis. Both rice and foxtail millet showed &gt;55% similarity to the sorghum genome. Conclusion: This study reports large variability for agronomic and biofuel traits in the sorghum minicore collection with high heritability. The genetic architecture of cell wall components using the GWAS approach was studied and candidate genes for each component were annotated. These results give a better understanding of the genetic basis of the sorghum cell wall composition. The association analysis identified regions of the genome that could be targeted to enhance the quality of biomass and yield along with the desired composition promoting breeding efficiency for enhanced biofuel yield. © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers.","Association mapping; Cellulose; Hemicellulose; Lignin; Manhattan plots; SNP; Sorghum minicore","biofuel; cellulose; hemicellulose; lignin; transcriptome; agronomic trait; Arabidopsis; Article; bioenergy; biofuel production; biomass; cell wall; computer model; controlled study; cross validation; flowering; foxtail millet; gene frequency; gene identification; gene locus; gene mapping; gene sequence; genome-wide association study; genotype; germplasm; heritability; maize; nonhuman; Panicum virgatum; phenotypic variation; plant breeding; plant environment interaction; plant genome; plant stem; rainy season; rice; sequence homology; single nucleotide polymorphism; sorghum; synteny; biomass; genetics; genome-wide association study; growth, development and aging; plant genome; single nucleotide polymorphism; Biofuels; Biomass; Genome, Plant; Genome-Wide Association Study; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Sorghum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116958786

The APR reaction was performed in a batch reactor under the following conditions: 20 bar, 230◦C 450 rpm, and 1 h of reaction time. The synthesized catalysts were characterized using XRD, FESEM, BET, and H2-TPR to observe the effect of Ca doping on the physio-chemical properties of the catalysts. The results revealed that, at higher Ca loading, the catalysts experienced serious particles’ agglomeration, which resulted in a larger particles’ size, smaller surface area, and smaller pore volume owing to uneven distribution of the particles. The characterization results of the catalysts confirmed that the Us catalysts have a slightly higher surface area, pore volume, and pore size, as well as highly reducible and fine crystalline structure, compared with WI catalysts. The catalytic performance of the catalysts shows that 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO) and 1,2-propanediol (1,2-PDO) were the two main liquid products produced from this reaction. The highest selectivity of 1,3-PDO (23.84%) was obtained over the 10%Ni/ZrO2 catalyst, while the highest selectivity of 1,2-PDO (25.87%) was obtained over the 10%Ni-5%Ca/ZrO2 catalyst. © 2021 by the authors.

In the present investigation, we developed a cost-effective and base metal-based NiCu/Laponite catalyst for liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural into fuel range components. The robust catalysts were prepared by a simple co-impregnation method with constant loading of 5 wt% NiO with different wt.% of CuO (x) loadings (where x = 8, 10, 12 &amp; 14%) on the Laponite support. The textural properties, surface acidity, and reduction of the synthesized catalysts were studied by employing various physicochemical characterizations such as XRD, N2 sorption analysis, NH3-TPD, H2-TPR, and TGA. The obtained results revealed that optimum loading of 12% CuO and 5% NiO catalyst aids fine dispersion of copper and nickel oxide on the surface of the support. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images displayed the delamination of Laponite particles and dispersion of Ni-Cu catalyst on the support surface.

The morphology tests demonstrate that the highly porous PtxNi1-x nanoalloys exhibit broader pore-size distribution and larger specific electrochemically active surface area than the Pt monometallic nanostructures. Combined with cyclic voltammograms, polarization parameters and cell tests, degradation behavior measurements prove that the nanoalloy products display the excellent long-term stability and high electrocatalytic activity. Controlling the preparation conditions of the highly porous PtxNi1-x nanoalloys could control the morphology and nanostructure of the as-synthesis nanoalloys in order to improve the catalytic performance of these nanoalloys, which grants it great potentialities for controllable synthesis of electrocatalysts in the application of GBFCs.

The two factors were found positively influencing the reaction conversion. The maximum observed conversion reached almost 100% at 21:1 M methanol to oil ratio and 3 wt% catalyst/oil ratio. Additionally, the kinetic study revealed that pseudo-second order kinetic model fits the experimental data well. In addition, the Arrhenius equation analysis showed lower activation energy and higher pre-exponential factor for methanolysis in comparison with ethanolysis indicating the faster kinetics.

The catalytic etherification of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF) is an effective approach for the production of liquid fuels. However, the development of high-performance and chemically stable catalysts has remained challenging. In this work, ultra-small Pd-Ru NPs were successfully immobilized on the surfaces of 2D MXene nanosheets (Pd-Ru/MXene) via fish sperm DNA-assisted microwave process. HR-TEM imaging results with SAED analysis showed that the hexagonal closed-pack (hcp) Pd-Ru NPs were grown on the surfaces of sheet-like MXene, thus enhancing the specific surface area of 117 m2 g−1 and providing a higher density of the acid-base sites. Furthermore, Pd-Ru/MXene was employed for the etherification of HMF into EMF. The results showed that the Pd-Ru/MXene catalyst exhibited 98% EMF yield and 100% HMF conversion with the prolonged usage of catalyst for five consecutive reuse cycles. Additionally, fructose was directly converted into EMF with a higher yield of 82% over the Pd-Ru/MXene catalyst at lower reaction conditions. The recyclability test of the used Pd-Ru/MXene catalyst demonstrated its chemical stability under prolonged usage for several hours and is therefore suitable for commercial renewable liquid fuel production. Novelty Statement: The catalytic transformation of biomass into diesel-miscible biofuel is a sustainable route for liquid fuel production and has recently attracted massive attention. The chemically stable and high-performance Pd-Ru/MXene catalyst was successfully prepared and characterized. The study demonstrated that the Pd-Ru/MXene catalyst exhibits superior catalytic activity toward the direct conversion of fructose and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) into 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (5-EMF), which is a promising conversion method for the production of biofuels from biomass. © 2021 The Authors.

Nine methyl ester components are identified in the biodiesel product, with 9-octadecanoic acid methyl ester (C18:2, 64.92%) and hexadecanoic acid methyl ester (C16:0, 16.44%) as the major constituents. The catalyst is evaluated over 4 cycles, maintaining a 92 ± 2% isolated yield. Physicochemical analysis of the spent catalyst by SEM-EDX suggests this decrease is due to some loss of mesoporosity and sulfur content. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","(trans)esterification; Biodiesel; Heterogeneous catalysis; Organocatalyst; Polymeric solid acid; Renewable energy","Catalysis; Catalyst activity; Esters; Formaldehyde; Palmitic acid; (trans)esterification; Biodiesel production; Jatropha Curcas oil; Mesoporous; Methyl esters; Organocatalysts; Polymeric catalysts; Polymeric solid acid; Renewable energies; ]+ catalyst; Biodiesel; angiosperm; biofuel; byproduct; catalysis; catalyst; formaldehyde; physicochemical property; polymer; sulfur; Jatropha; Jatropha curcas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103980455

The silver performed synergistic effects with CaO on promoting biodiesel production. The CaO/Ag nano catalysts exhibited abundant strong basic sites with larger BET surface area (7.02 vs 2.05 m2/g), pore diameter (58.84 vs 37.08 nm) and pore volume (0.070 vs 0.016 cm3/g), which significantly reduced mass transfer resistance of triglycerides during transesterification and improved the mass transfer constants. Response surface methodology was applied to investigate the influence reaction parameters and optimize biodiesel yield. A maximized biodiesel yield of 90.95 ± 2.56 % was achieved using methanol:oil molar ratio of 13, CaO/Ag loading of 5%, reaction time of 90 min and reaction temperature of 72℃. The optimized biodiesel yield for CaO catalyzed transesterification was 88.40 ± 3.34 %, using similar reaction conditions but with 180 min of reaction time. Both nano catalysts were consecutively reused for five times. Kinetic and thermodynamic studies of CaO and CaO/Ag catalyzed transesterification were performed and compared.

The biochar presented micrometric particles with a porous structure, with a surface area between 203 and 231 m2 g-1 and amorphous aspect containing crystalline quartz structures. The superior calorific power (SCP) for different biochar was 5.9-7.6 MJ kg-1. Bio-oils presented fatty acids, alcohols and esters with long aliphatic chains as main constituents. The SCP of these materials showed a high value (41 MJ kg-1), with the possibility to be used as a precursor for the biofuels production. The biochar, was applied as an adsorbent for the methylene blue (MB) dye from aqueous system. The adsorption parameters such as contact time (0-120 min), adsorbent dosage (0.25-1.0 g L-1) and initial pH (5-9.5) were studied. Kinetics and adsorption isotherm studies were also carried out. Pseudo-second order and Langmuir isotherm models fit the data better, showing adsorption maximum amount of 51 mg g-1 at 45 °C. The MB removal by biochar is an endothermic process and the material can be reactivated and reused.

To meet the energy requirement, the use of fossil fuels is not a good decision, causing environmental pollution such as CO2 emissions. Therefore, the use of renewable energy sources like biofuels can meet the energy crisis especially for countries facing oil shortages such as Pakistan. This review describes the comparative study of biodiesel synthesis for various edible oils, non-edible oils, and wastes such as waste plastic oil, biomass pyrolysis oil, and tyre pyrolysis oil in terms of their oil content and extraction, cetane number, and energy content. The present study also described the importance of biodiesel synthesis via catalytic transesterification and its implementation in Pakistan. Pakistan is importing an extensive quantity of cooking oil that is used in the food processing industries, and as a result, a huge quantity of waste cooking oil (WCO) is generated. The potential waste oils for biodiesel synthesis are chicken fat, dairy scum, WCO, and tallow oil that can be used as potential substrates of biodiesel. The implementation of a biodiesel program as a replacement of conventional diesel will help to minimize the oil imports and uplift the country's economy. Biodiesel production via homogeneous and heterogeneous catalyzed transesterification is more feasible among all transesterification processes due to a lesser energy requirement and low cost. Therefore, biodiesel synthesis and implementation could minimize the imports of diesel by significantly contributing to the overall Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Although, waste oil can meet the energy needs, more available cultivation land should be used for substrate cultivation. In addition, research is still needed to explore innovative solvents and catalysts so that overall biodiesel production cost can be minimized. This would result in successful biodiesel implementation in Pakistan. © 2021 The Authors. Published by American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111333173

The etheric C-O hydrogenolysis activity was found to be in the order NiMoY30 &gt; NiMoY12 &gt; NiMoY80, despite a high initial rate of C-O cleavage over NiMoY12 owing to its high acid density. A high degree of hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) and hydrocracking reactions were observed with NiMoY30 yielding &gt;80% of deoxygenated products of which ∼58% are benzene, toluene, and ethylbenzenes. A similar experiment with DHDPM showed the rapid cleavage of the methylene-linked C-C dimer (sp3-sp2) to phenols and cresols even with the low acid density (high SAR) catalyst, NiMoY80. Direct hydrocracking of the recalcitrant 5-5′ linkage in 2PP is very slow, however, it cleavedviaa cascade of HDO, ring-hydrogenation, and hydrocracking reactions. A high degree of hydrogenolysis and hydrocracking occurs over NiMoY30 due to suitable balance between acidity and pore accessibility, enhanced proximity between acidic and deoxygenation sites leading to a slightly higher dispersion of Ni promoted MoS2crystallites. Overall, the product spectrum consisted of a high yield of deoxygenated products. The carbon content on the recovered catalyst was in the range of 3-7 wt%. These results pave the way for effective catalysts to break recalcitrant linkages present in lignin to obtain a hydrocarbon-rich liquid transportation fuel. An experiment with Kraft lignin over NiMoY30 shows good selectivity for deoxygenated aromatics and cycloalkanes in the liquid phase. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.",,"Autoclaves; Binary alloys; Catalysts; Hydrogenolysis; Hydrolysis; Lignin; Silica; Sulfur compounds; Ternary alloys; Zeolites; Autoclave reactors; Carbon content; Hydrodeoxygenation; Hydrotreatment; Liquid transportation; Product spectrums; Ring hydrogenation; Total pressure; Hydrocracking; aluminum oxide; biofuel; BTEX; cracking (chemistry); experimental study; hydrogen; lignin; pressure; silica; solvent; sulfide; zeolite; Autoclaves; Catalysts; Hydrogenolysis; Hydrolysis; Silica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108873484

However, there is still a lack of accurate description of the reaction kinetics. This is in part due to the complexity of the reacting system in which a large number of interconnected reactions take place simultaneously. In this work, attention is focused on the biphasic character of the reaction medium, formed by two immiscible liquid phases. The behavior of the phases is investigated regarding their physicochemical properties, mainly density and mutual solubility of the components, as well as composition. In addition, two kinetic models with different level of complexity regarding the biphasic character of the reaction medium have been developed. It has been found that a heterogeneous model considering the presence of the two phases and the distribution of the several compounds between them is indispensable to get a good description of the process in terms of oil conversion and products yields. The model captures the effects of the main variables of an isothermal batch methanolysis process: methanol/oil molar ratio, reaction time and catalyst concentration. Nevertheless, some adjustment is still required as concerns modelling of the saponification reactions and catalyst deactivation. © 2021 by the authors.

Nannochloropsis oculata is a species of marine microalgae that is easily cultivated and has a high content of lipid. N. oculata lipids can be extracted efficiently using NiO nanocatalyst as cell disruption agent and organic solvents. The optimal treatment time for NiO nanocatalyst is 96 hours in chloroform. At the optimized conditions, the lipid extract from N. oculata reached 34.20 ± 0.52% of the total weight. The conversion of microalgal oil into biodiesel is carried out with a transesterification reaction using three different catalysts, respectively. Biodiesel conversion with NiO nanocatalyst is better than that with the other catalysts of NaOH and HCl. The conversion yield of microalgal oil to biodiesel with NiO nanocatalyst reaches 89.72%. Based on the advantage of NiO nanocatalyst as both a cell disruption agent and a catalyst, biodiesel production can be performed in an in-situ way.

The current research is a 'first of its kind' where hydrodynamic cavitation is integrated with heterogeneous catalyst, i.e. TiO2, to prepare thumba methyl esters (TME). So far, no studies on biodiesel production using heterogeneous catalysts using HC are reported in the literature. Experiments were performed with an optimized orifice plate to investigate the effects of operating parameters viz., Thumba oil to methanol molar ratio (1:4–1:8), TiO2 concentration (1–1.4% by weight of oil), and operating temperature (50 °C to 70 °C). Maximum triglyceride conversion (71.8%) was obtained at thumba oil to methanol ratio of 1:6, TiO2 concentration of 1.2% weight percentage and operating temperature of 60 °C in hydrodynamic cavitation reactor within 1 h at 5 bar. The cavitational yield for HC was found to be 9.3 × 10−6 moles L/J, which was almost 27% higher than the value for the conventional approach (3.37 × 10−7 moles L/J). The experimental data fitted second-order reaction kinetics w.r.t limiting reactant, i.e., thumba oil and first-order w.r.t excess reactant, i.e., methanol. The pre-exponential factor (k0) and activation energy (E) of the alcoholysis reaction was found to be 82.26 L2 mol−2 min−1 and 15.44 kJ/mol, respectively. The thermodynamic analysis suggested that the alcoholysis of the thumba oil followed the endergonic reaction pathway. Thumba methyl ester (TME) synthesized via this intensified approach is a novel and energy-efficient method compared to the conventional method. © 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers","Alcoholysis; Biodiesel; Citrullus colocyntis; Hydrodynamic cavitation; Sustainable energy","Activation energy; Catalysts; Cavitation; Energy efficiency; Esters; Hydrodynamics; Methanol; Molar concentration; Molar ratio; Oxide minerals; Reaction kinetics; Temperature; Thermoanalysis; Titanium dioxide; Alcoholysis reactions; Conventional approach; Heterogeneous catalyst; Hydrodynamic cavitations; Operating temperature; Preexponential factor; Process intensification; Thermo dynamic analysis; Biodiesel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106901392

Herein, N,P,S tri-doped holey carbon (NPS-HC) nanomaterials have been prepared using a one-step method with large specific surface area (1656.0 m2 g−1), abundant holes and edges, and high heteroatom content (7.57 at.%). The optimized NPS-HC exhibits outstanding ORR performance in universal pH mediums, being closely comparable to the commercial Pt/C. The NPS-HC is also utilized as air cathode in alkaline (peak power density: 286.6 mW cm−2 @ 488.1 mA cm−2) and neutral (85.7 mW cm−2 @ 228.8 mA cm−2) electrolytic Zn-air batteries as well as the ORR cathode in a practical PEMFC (275.1 mW cm−2) with comparable or superior performances than the previous reports. Such excellent electrocatalytic performance is attributed to the N,P,S tri-doping induced synergistic charge transfer and spin redistribution along with the hierarchical holey structure with exposed active sites and facilitated mass transport. Thus, this earth-abundant carbon-based nanomaterial holds great potential for high-performance pH-universal ORR catalysis in various energy-related technologies. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Green energy devices; Metal-free carbon-based catalyst; Oxygen reduction reaction; pH-universal performance; Tri-doping","Alkalinity; Carbon; Cathodes; Charge transfer; Electrocatalysts; Electrolytic reduction; Nanostructured materials; Oxygen; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Zinc; Green energy device; Metal-free carbon-based catalyst; Oxygen Reduction; Oxygen reduction reaction; Performance; pH range; Ph-universal performance; Proton-exchange membranes fuel cells; Reaction performance; Tri-doping; Zinc air batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105356464

The promotion of renewable energy sources is a promising solution to tackle these challenges. Among these, syngas production from biogas via dry reforming of methane shows great potential as a green alternative to meet global environmental goals. The purpose of this work is to estimate the potential of syngas production from biogas in the UK and its profitability. To estimate the syngas production, we present an overview of methane dry reforming to syngas. This analysis reveals that nickel/alumina catalysts are the most popular choice for the mentioned reaction. Afterwards, the potential biogas production in the UK is obtained. Both set of data are subsequently combined to estimate the potential for syngas production from biomass in the UK. A techno-economic analysis is performed to estimate the syngas price to reach profitability. This analysis reveals syngas prices ranging from 1.15 to 1.56 €/m3 to overcome production costs, which is higher than producing syngas from traditional fossil fuels. Further analysis has also been conducted to estimate the production of different utilisation routes for said syngas including biofuel, methanol and electricity. © 2021 The Authors","Biogas upgrading; Biomass utilisation; Profitability analysis; Renewable energy; Syngas production","Biogas; Catalytic reforming; Costs; Economic analysis; Fossil fuels; Methane; Profitability; Renewable energy resources; Synthesis gas manufacture; Biogas upgrading; Biomass utilization; Dry reforming-of-methane; Environmental challenges; Profitability analysis; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Syn gas; Syngas production; United kingdom; Synthesis gas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104938406

Four magnetic nanocomposites (graphene and chitosan based) were fabricated using single pot solvothermal carbonization co-precipitation (STCC) route by integrating biomass functionalized with iron oxide nanoparticles. All hybrid nanocomposites were characterized for their magnetic, thermal, chemical and structural properties. Adsorption isotherms and kinetics studies were performed for adsorption of multi-heavy metals including Cd, Ni, Cu and Cr. Finally, the hybrid magnetic carbon nanocomposites were tested as catalysts to produce bio-oil through catalytic liquefaction of rice husk in supercritical ethanol. It was found that the bio-oil yield and overall conversion was enhanced significantly from 29.5% and 48.11% without catalyst, to 36.8% and 60.81% respectively with the presence of magnetic carbon nanocomposites as catalyst. Furthermore, the bio-oil energy quality was enhanced in energy content from 21.72 to 23.21 MJ/kg with the presence of catalyst and H/C and O/C ratios were reduced.

The stone and the bio-based catalyst obtained from it were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, thermogravimetric analysis, surface area, and soluble alkalinity. It was confirmed that the stone is composed of aragonite (calcium carbonate) and the catalyst obtained by calcination of calcium oxide (CaO). The catalytic activity was evaluated by transesterification reactions. The process was optimized by surface response methodology based on Box – Behnken design. Methanol:oil molar ratio of 11.8, 5.33 wt% of catalyst, 175 min of reaction time, and 67.85 °C were identified as optimal conditions, reaching conversions close to 99% and ester content of 97.4%.

Thus, biodiesel can be obtained from different vegetable oils or animal fats using catalysts. The aim of this research was to prepare the Fe3O4/MnO2 nanocomposite and test them as catalyst to efficiently obtain biofuel like the final product from the oil obtained from seeds and grapes residues by microwave-assisted transesterification. Synthesized Fe3O4/MnO2 nanocomposites using chemically and biochemically (using plant extracts) route were characterized regarding size, crystallinity, composition, porosity and specific surface area. The analysis of the final results revealed that the samples chemically prepared show smaller sizes, specific surface area higher and porosity lower than the sample prepared using plant extract. The Fe3O4/MnO2 nanocomposites with the highest specific surface area from all prepared nanocomposites were tested for microwave-assisted transesterification studies. These nanocomposites, used as catalyst, determine an increasing reaction rate of the transesterification process thus being a promising route for biodiesel production. © 2021, Institute of Chemistry, Slovak Academy of Sciences.","Biodiesel; Catalyst; Iron oxide; Manganese oxide; Nanocomposite; Oregano extract",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103221429

In this research the potential of pyrolysis method to convert granular bacteria biomass to biofuels was completely investigated. The non-catalytic experiments were performed in a temperature range of 400 to 700 °C and the maximum liquid product yield on dry ash-free basis (55.0 %wt.) was obtained at optimum temperature of 550 °C. Pyrolysis of pretreated granular bacteria with 5 wt% HCl (PGB) and then impregnation with Na2CO3 (IPGB) was studied to improve the bio-oil quality as well as higher amount of synthesis gas. Feedstock pretreatment with acid decreased the gas yield in 550 °C while Na2CO3 pretreatment had reverse effect, with H2 yield (mmol/g feed) of 2.9, 2.4 and 1.8 for IPGB, GB and PGB respectively. It means Na2CO3 exhibited excellent catalytic activity toward producing hydrogen-rich hydrocarbons. Acid treatment increased bio-oil weight percent with little effect on the quality, while the IPGB pyrolysis resulted 8.3% and 8.6% decrease in the oxygenates and nitrogenates respectively and 19.5% increase in the hydrocarbons which improved the higher heating value (HHV) from 32.6 MJ/kg to 33.7 MJ/kg in comparison with GB.

Due to high oil content containment, biofuel researchers emphasized poultry waste as abundant, cheap, and high-quality feedstock for biodiesel production. Therefore, in the current study, an experimental investigation of biodiesel production from wasted chicken skin through the transesterification process has been performed. The chicken skin used in this study for biodiesel production can be used as the potential waste source for biodiesel production worldwide. Techno-economic, environmental, and sustainability analyses were also performed. During the synthesis, the reaction was conducted with potassium hydroxide (KOH), and the process yielded 48% biodiesel. The cost of electricity for providing electricity is estimated at US$0.575 per kWh when an auto-sized generator has been fueled by biodiesel.

By the method of isovolumetric impregnation plus in-situ activation by CS2, a sulfurated NiMo/activated clay catalyst was prepared, and the structure and performance of the catalyst were studied by XRD, BET, Py-FTIR and NH3-TPD techniques. The effects of different reaction conditions such as reaction temperature, catalyst dosage, hydrogen pressure, reaction time on the reaction were investigated. The experimental results show that the optimal reaction conditions are as follows: the reaction temperature is 300 ℃, the catalyst mass fraction is 7.5%, the initial hydrogen pressure of the reaction is 3.5 MPa, and the reaction time is 60 min. Under these conditions, the conversion ratio of jatropha oil and the selectivity to C15-C18 reached 84.53% and 95.19%, respectively. The main components of optimal product were analyzed.

Hydrogen is also being employed for formulating fuels such as hydrogen compressed natural gas in the gaseous form and hydrogenated biofuels in the liquid form. The present study evaluates (i) hydrogen usage on the fuel formulation and (ii) investigates the engine operation of an automotive turbocharged diesel engine operated with karanja biodiesel blended diesel (B20) as a reference fuel. Existing literature outlines that biodiesel blends possess lower energy content and emit higher nitric oxide (NO) emission than fossil diesel. The present research paper partially hydrogenates karanja biodiesel using an autoclave reactor with a palladium catalyst to increase the saturation levels and mitigate the biodiesel-NO penalty. Besides, the drop in energy release of B20 is compensated through the provision of hydrogen induction along the intake manifold. The hydrogen flow rates to the turbocharged engine are maintained at a fixed energy share of 10%. Both biodiesel and hydrogenated biodiesel were blended on a volume basis (20%) with fossil diesel (80%) and are designated as B20 and HB20, respectively. The test results reveal that HB20 effectively mitigates the biodiesel-NO penalty with a maximum reduction of 29.8% compared to B20. Further, hydrogen induction yielded a significant improvement (23.7%) in fuel consumption with HB20 relative to B20 without hydrogen addition. The compounding effect of hydrogen usage on the engine operation and fuel formulation exhibited a better performance and emission trade-off at mid load conditions. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Combustion; Hydrogen induction; Karanja biodiesel; Nitric oxide; Partial hydrogenation; Smoke emissions","Biodiesel; Compressed air; Compressed natural gas; Diesel engines; Economic and social effects; Hydrogen; Hydrogen fuels; Hydrogenation; Nanocatalysts; Nitric oxide; Pressure vessels; Smoke; Combustion engines; Comparatives studies; Engine operations; Fuel formulation; Hydrogen induction; Internal combustion; Karanja; Karanjum biodiesel; Partial hydrogenation; Smoke Emission; Combustion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105330216

In this work, TiO2 nanoparticles supported on exfoliated montmorillonite, with strong Lewis acid sites and abundant accessible Brønsted acid sites, is used to catalyze the acetalization reactions of biomass-derived furfural and alcohols. Low dosage of the catalyst made the reaction reach equilibrium in a very short time (TOF=690–1305 min−1) at room temperature with the acetal as the only product. In continuous-flow reactions, the catalyst showed a stable product output with conversion close to that for the batch reaction with a short catalyst-reactant contact time of 150 s. Contrast experiments revealed that both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites on the catalyst were indispensable for maximizing the catalytic performance, and simultaneously activating both furfural and alcohol on the adjacent Lewis and Brønsted acid sites was proposed to be responsible for the high catalytic performance. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","acetalization; biomass; furfural derivatives; heterogeneous catalysis; solid acids","Aldehydes; Biofuels; Clay minerals; Furfural; Nanoparticles; Oxidation resistance; Oxide minerals; TiO2 nanoparticles; Titanium dioxide; Acetalization reaction; Catalytic performance; Continuous flow reaction; Continuous flows; Contrast experiment; High catalytic performance; High-calorific-value; Montmorillonite composites; Nanocatalysts",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107251418

The extraction is performed by using 0.20 and 0.15 weight equivalents of CO2 and H2SO4 respectively. Herein, we describe lignin esterification with fatty acids using benign reagents to generate a lignin ester mixable with gas oils. The esterification is accomplished by activating the fatty acid and lignin with acetic anhydride which can be regenerated from the acetic acid recycled in this reaction. The resulting mass balance ratio is fatty acid/lignin/acetic acid (2 : 1 : 0.1). This lignin ester can be hydroprocessed to generate hydrocarbons in gasoline, aviation, and diesel range. A 300-hour continuous production of fuel was accomplished. By recirculating reagents from both the esterification step and applying a water gas shift reaction on off-gases from the hydroprocessing, a favorable overall mass balance is realized. © 2021 The Authors.

In the present work Verrucodesmus verrucosus was evaluated under autotrophic growth conditions as a suitable source of oil for biodiesel production. For this purpose BG11 media were evaluated in three different light:dark photoperiods (L:D; 16:08; 12:12; 24:0) and light intensities (1000, 2000 and 3000 Lux) in a photobioreactor with a capacity of three liters; the evaluation of the microalgal biomass was carried out through the cell count with the use of the Neubauer chamber followed by the evaluation of the kinetic growth parameters. So, the lipid accumulation was determined through the lipid extraction with a Soxhlet system. Finally, the fatty acid profile of the total pooled lipids was determined using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). The results demonstrate that the best conditions are a photoperiod of 12 light hours and 12 dark hours with BG11 medium in a 3 L tubular photobioreactor with 0.3% CO2, 25◦C and 2000 Lux, allowing a lipid accumulation of 50.42%.

It is also a way of gradually becoming less dependent on the depleting petroleum resources. New resources for producing biodiesel are currently being sought. The authors produced esters from animal fat waste, obtaining a fuel that can power diesel engines and identifying a way to utilise unnecessary waste. The animal fat methyl ester (AME) was produced using a reactor constructed for non‐industrial ester production. The aim underlying this paper was to determine whether a diesel engine can be fuelled with AME biodiesel and to test this fuel’s impact on exhaust gas composition and fuel consumption. Fuelling a Perkins 1104D‐44TA engine with AME biodiesel led to a reduction in the smoke opacity of the exhaust gas as well as in carbohydrate, particulate matter, and carbon monoxide concentrations. The carbon dioxide concentrations were similar for biodiesel and diesel fuel. Slight increases in nitrogen oxides concentrations and brake‐specific fuel consumption were found for AMEs. An engine can be fuelled with AME biodiesel, but it is necessary to improve its low‐temperature properties. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the economic aspects associated with its use remain a significant challenge. Spirulina cultivated in wastewater decreased the concentrations of both ammonia and nitrate and also served as a biodiesel source. The oil obtained in the feedstock was subjected to transesterification and turned into biodiesel. The biodiesel was subsequently analyzed in a test motor (water-cooled, four-stroke, single-cylinder compression ignition with injection). The tests were conducted at a constant 1500 rpm, and the output power was 3.7 kW. Mixtures of diesel and biodiesel were also enriched with carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The amount of CNTs added to the diesel was 30 mg L−1 . The algae and de-oiled biomass were characterized using XRD analysis, and an ultrasonicator was used to mix the CNTs with diesel and spirulina blends. A series of tests were conducted at different load conditions (25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) for all fuel blends. Test results were compared with a neat diesel engine with a CR of 17.5:1. Among the fuel blends, the B25 reported improved brake thermal efficiency and reduced emissions. The outcomes are a reduction in thermal efficiency of 0.98% and exhaust gas temperature of 1.7%. The addition of Spirulina biodiesel blends had a positive impact on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, including reductions of 16.3%, 3.6%, 6.8%, and 12.35% of CO, NOx, and smoke, respectively. The specific fuel consumption and CO2 emissions were reduced by 5.2% and 2.8%, respectively, for B25 fuel blends compared to plain diesel and B50. Concerning cost competitiveness, vigorous research on microalgae for the production of biodiesel can cut production costs in the future. © 2021 by the authors.

The samples displayed changes in their morphologies and observable increment in the surface area, total basicity, and ion exchange capacity with increasing the synthesis period. The samples were used as potential basic catalysts in the transesterification of the waste products of corn oil. The produced sodalite sample after 48 h (SD-48) achieved the best catalytic activity and the best biodiesel yield (95.4%). This yield was obtained after 120 min at 70 C using 16:1 methanol-to corn oil molar ratio and 4 wt., % SD-48 loading. The achieved yields by SD-24 and SD-72 are 84.7% and 90.5%, respectively. The higher activity of SD-48 (95.4%) than SD-24 (84.7%) related to its high surface area and total basicity. The lower activity of SD-72 (90.5%) than SD-48 (95.4%) related to its very high ion exchange capacity which increases the saponification reactions in the existence of K+ and Na+ ions at high concentrations.

In addition, the CaO nanocatalyst preparation method via thermal hydration–dehydration-related parameters (hydration duration, recalcination temperature, and recalcination duration) was studied and optimized. The transesterification reaction catalyzed by the CaO nanocatalyst followed the Langmuir–Hinshelwood kinetic mechanism with surface reaction as the rate-limiting step. The relatively low activation energy (3786.7 J/mol) for a transesterification reaction offered by the CaO nanocatalyst enhanced the reaction rate to 27.3% FAME yield/hr. The optimal conditions for the thermal hydration–dehydration treatment used to develop the nano CaO catalyst were 6 h of hydration duration, 650◦ C of recalcination temperature, and 3 h of recalcination duration. Of biodiesel yield, 94.13% was obtained at a moderate temperature of 60◦ C and 3 h reaction time during the transesterification of palm oil catalyzed by the nano-CaO. SEM, BET, and TPD results proved that the CaO nanocatalyst had a large surface area (13.9113 m2 /g) and high pore volume (0.0318 cm3 /g) that were rich in active sites (1046.46 µmol CO2 /g), and the pore diameter (33.17 nm) was accessible to reactants and products. © 2021 by the authors.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) was introduced as the reaction atmosphere to further improve the quality of biofuel produced by microwave pyrolysis of food waste (FW). The results showed the bio-gas yield and the syngas concentration (H2 + CO) increased to 70.34 wt% and 61.50 mol%, respectively, using Fe3O4 as the catalyst. The content of aliphatic hydrocarbons in bio-oil produced with the catalyst Fe2O3 increased to 67.48% and the heating value reached 30.45 MJ/kg. Compared with Fe2O3 catalyst, Fe3O4 exhibited better microwave absorption properties and catalytic properties. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) characterizations confirmed that the crystal surface of Fe3O4 formed more oxygen vacancy defects and unpaired electrons. Additionally, according to the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, the content of lattice oxygen in Fe3O4 was 14.11%, a value that was much lower than Fe2O3 (38.54%). The oxygen vacancy defects not only improved the efficient utilization of microwave energy but also provided the reactive sites for the reaction between the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and CO2 to generate CO.

This study statistically optimized the covalent immobilization of Candida rugosa lipase (CRL) onto biomass-based nanocellulose-silica (NC-SiO2) reinforced polyethersulfone (PES) membrane to synthesize PeVa. Raman spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy of NC-SiO2-PES/CRL proved that CRL was successfully conjugated to the membrane. The optimized Taguchi Design-assisted immobilization of CRL onto NC-SiO2-PES membrane (5% glutaraldehyde, 4 h of immobilization, 20 mg/mL CRL concentration, 40 °C and pH 5) gave 90% yield of PeVa in 3 h. The thermal stability of NC-SiO2-PES/CRL was ~ 30% greater over the free CRL, with reusability for up to 14 successive esterification cycles. In a nutshell, the greener NC-SiO2-PES membrane effectively hyperactivated and stabilized the CRL for the esterification production of PeVa.

Herein, three-dimensional pompon-like well-defined RuCo particles with tunable crystallographic structures and surface atomically dispersed Ru atoms were constructed and intensively investigated as support-free metal catalysts in the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of lignin-derived guaiacol. It was demonstrated that the 300 °C-reduced RuCo sample possessed the hexagonal close-packed (hcp) crystallographic structure with surface abundant atomically dispersed Ru atoms, whereas 600 °C-reduced RuCo sample presented the face-centered cubic phase with lower surface Ru concentration. The as-fabricated RuCo-300 sample showed excellent catalytic HDO activity with a high cyclohexane yield of 85.3%. Comprehensive structural characterizations unveiled that the introduction of atomically dispersed Ru atoms into the RuCo-300 favored the formation of abundant surface Ru-Co sites, as well as electron-rich Ru0, and such-constructed Ru-Co sites were highly beneficial to the hydrogen dissociation on single Ru0 atoms and the further hydrogen spillover to adjacent Co0 atoms to promote the HDO process. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the hcp structure of RuCo catalysts benefited the adsorption of guaiacol. The unique pompon-like microstructure of RuCo catalysts was conducive to the exposure of active sites and provided more open channels for the easy diffusion of reactants and products. Over the RuCo-300 catalyst, the guaiacol HDO could proceed rapidly via an initial demethoxylation reaction. The present Ru-Co synergetic catalysis in the structure of RuCo catalysts would provide a new strategy for constructing robust heterogeneous bimetal catalysts applied in practical HDO processes of a variety of lignin-derived phenolic compounds. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Atomically dispersed Ru atoms; Crystallographic structure; Hydrodeoxygenation; Ru-Co sites; RuCo particles","Alcohols; Atoms; Binary alloys; Biofuels; Catalyst activity; Cobalt alloys; Density functional theory; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogen; Lignin; Ruthenium; Crystallographic structure; Environmental pollutions; Face centered cubic phase; Greenhouse gases emissions; Hexagonal close packed; Hydrogen dissociation; Structural characterization; Synergetic catalysis; Ruthenium alloys; Alcohols; Atoms; Fossil Fuels; Greenhouse Gases; Hydrogen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105283000

For this purpose, the surface characterization of the catalyst was determined using SEM, EDX/Map, XRD, VSM, BET, TGA-DTG, CO2-TPD and FTIR analyses. The catalyst could be easily removed from the reactant due to its paramagnetic property. The BET analysis showed that the MnFe2O4/GO catalyst has a significant specific surface area, which is suitable for the transesterification reaction. Also, the CO2-TPD analysis showed that the MnFe2O4/GO catalyst has two broad and strong peaks at a temperature range of 800–900 °C, which indicates strong interactions between CO2 and active sites on the catalyst surface. Moreover, the total number of basic sites on the catalyst surface was obtained 3978.6 μmol of CO2/g of the catalyst, which is a significant value. Due to the presence of high free fatty acids (2.43 wt%) in the WEO, a hydrochloric acid catalyst was used to reduce free fatty acid content before the transesterification process using the MnFe2O4/GO catalyst. The highest biodiesel yield was obtained 96.47%, which was a remarkable value compared to previous works. According to HNMR analysis, a peak was observed at 3.7 ppm, which was attributed to the methoxy group (O–CH3) on the methyl ester, indicating that biodiesel was properly produced. Then, biodiesel was blended with petro-diesel in various proportions (B25–B100) to improve its physical properties. According to the results, the physical characteristics of the biodiesel like flash point, viscosity, cloud point, density and pour point were obtained 176 °C, 5.4 mm2/s, 5 °C, −1 °C, and 882 kg/m3, respectively. Among these properties, the cloud point is not suitable and demonstrates that pure biodiesel can't be used in the engine in cold weather and should be used in combination with diesel.

The bio-based products such as biodiesel and bio-compressed natural gas (Bio-CNG) can be less expensive and adaptable. Biofuels are increasingly being used in transportation, heat, and power development requiring the need for renewable sources of energy. This review highlights the use of dreck organic matters from aquatic environment and soil supplies for renewable energy production for human requirements, sustaining a clean and healthy environment. Dreck can be harnessed to manufacture bioenergy that would help to mitigate greenhouse gases and preserve the environment. Methane, hydrogen, ethanol, bioelectricity, algal diesel, and butanol, or other forms of fuels provide a renewable supply of bioenergy, which can be created by the biological systems. The waste-to-energy methodologies (thermal plus biochemical) for energy production via agro-residues are covered. The key focus of this study is the recent advances in the area of 'synchronous waste mitigation with energy development' techniques. This review addresses the significance of organic substances for the production of clean and renewable energy, including alternate solutions for non-renewable fuels.

Aquatic biomass has gained more attention to biofuels generation in recent years due to its renewable, abundant, and environmentally friendly aspects. Macroalgae are photosynthetic organisms that are found in both marine and freshwater environments. These are considered as a third-generation feedstock for the production of biofuels since they have the ability to synthesize a high amount of lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates. This research study aimed to evaluate the potential of bioethanol production from macroalgae (Rhizoclonium sp.) biomass. The fermentation process was applied in the research by two-way separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF). Algae biomass undergoes a pretreatment process to release necessary sugars for yeast digestion. The fermentation process was carried at 30 to 35 °C in the incubator. Finally, the percentage of ethanol was estimated by the ebulliometer.

Understanding the adsorption of reactants, cascade reactions, and desorption of byproducts is essential for developing efficient and selective catalysts. Herein, the most plausible reaction mechanisms for the conversion of 5-HMF to 2,5-DMF over the Pd(111), Cu(111), and Cu3Pd(111) surfaces are investigated using density functional theory calculations. The reaction pathways for the formation of reaction intermediates (2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan, 5-methylfurfural, and 5-methylfurfuryl alcohol (5-MFA)), 2,5-DMF, and byproducts (water, 2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran (2,5-DMTHF)) are established. The overall reaction barrier on the Pd(111) surface, which is governed by the hydrogenolysis of the C-OH bonds in 5-MFA, is larger (1.96 eV) than that on the Cu3Pd(111) surface (1.68 eV). In addition, the significantly higher adsorption energy of 2,5-DMF on the Pd(111) surface (-2.47 eV) than on the Cu3Pd(111) surface (-0.18 eV), which is caused by the flat adsorption geometry with a η2-(C-O)-aldehyde configuration, leads to the formation of 2,5-DMTHF via furan ring saturation. Even though the overall energy barrier on the Cu(111) surface (0.84 eV) is much lower than those on the Pd(111) and Cu3Pd(111) surfaces, the weak perpendicular adsorption of 5-HMF in a η1-(O)-aldehyde configuration, highly unfavorable dissociative H2 adsorption, and high energy required for the formation of H2O hinder the conversion of 5-HMF and its intermediates. The favorable adsorption of 5-HMF (-0.54 eV), low overall reaction barrier, facile desorption of 2.5-DMF (-0.18 eV), and low energy barrier for dissociative H2 adsorption render the Pd-Cu alloy catalyst a promising candidate for the selective conversion of 5-HMF to 2,5-DMF. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,"Adsorption; Aldehydes; Aromatic compounds; Binary alloys; Catalysts; Copper alloys; Density functional theory; Desorption; Dissociation; Energy barriers; Furfural; Hydrogenolysis; Hydrolysis; Methanol; Organic pollutants; Reaction intermediates; Adsorption energies; Adsorption geometries; Cascade reactions; Metallic catalysts; Overall reactions; Reaction mechanism; Reaction pathways; Selective catalysts; Palladium alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106368745

In electrolysis, hydroxyl ions are generated from water in close proximity to the cathode. When hydroxyl ions react with methanol, they produce a species of nucleophilic methoxide which is the main actor in converting WFO into FAME. This study specifically investigates the effects of voltage, catalyst concentration, co solvent amount, rotation speed, and molar ratio of methanol to WFO in electrolytic transesterification converting WFO into FAME using graphite electrodes in the presence of a heterogeneous, catalytic zeolite–chitosan composite. With an alcohol to WFO molar ratio of 8:1, 1 wt% zeolite-chitosan composite concentration at 40 V in the presence of 2 wt% H2O of the whole solution at room temperature and stirrer rate of 400 rpm and reaction time of 30 min, a 96.5% yield of FAME was achieved.

Tyler Mall, Tempe, AZ  85287, United States","Upgrading fatty acids to hydrocarbons via deoxygenation is significant for the synthesis of high-grade biofuels. Developing economic reaction conditions without using noble metal-based catalysts in the absence of hydrogen and solvent has promising application prospects. Herein, carbon-coated bimetallic FeNi nanoparticles were prepared via an in-situ carbonization-reduction strategy using double-metal cyanide at different temperatures for the deoxygenation of stearic acid. The size of the alloy core and the thickness of the carbon shell were found to be easily adjusted by varying temperature. Compared with monometallic Fe/C and Ni/C catalysts, the alloy catalyst exhibits an obvious improvement in both the conversion of stearic acid and the selectivity of heptadecane. ATR-IR spectra show that the insertion of the inert Fe element into Ni nanoparticles can promote carboxylic acid group adsorption but restrain hydrocarbon group adsorption. The synergistic effect of Fe and Ni elements leads to the promotion of direct decarboxylation of stearic acid and suppression of the C–C cracking reaction. Among different alloy catalysts studied, FeNi@C-800 exhibits the greatest catalytic performance with a 99.9% conversion of stearic acid and 76.8% selectivity for heptadecane. Furthermore, the catalyst can still maintain a stable catalytic performance against the leaching and ripening of metal through the protection afforded by the carbon shell. This work not only provides a powerful reaction system for the decarboxylation of stearic acid but also demonstrates an alternative catalyst to noble metals based on a convenient carbonization-reduction strategy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbonization-reduction; Deoxygenation; Double-metal cyanide; FeNi@C core shell; Stearic acid","Binary alloys; Carbon; Carbonization; Carboxylation; Hydrocarbons; Hydrogen; Iron; Iron alloys; Metal nanoparticles; Petroleum prospecting; Precious metals; Stearic acid; Alternative catalysts; Application prospect; Carboxylic acid groups; Catalytic performance; Double metal cyanides; Fe-ni nanoparticles; Metal-based catalysts; Varying temperature; Catalyst selectivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100816049

To strengthen the stability, different supports are composited with the SrO–CaO oxide through the hydrothermal method and mass ratio of SrO to CaO are optimized to get the best outcome of the catalyst. Meanwhile, various characterization methods, including TG, XRD, SEM-EDX, CO2-TPD, XPS, ATR-FTIR and ICP-AES, are used to explore the physicochemical properties of catalysts.

Herein, a series of novel amphipathic ionic liquids (ILs) based on the 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) were prepared for the transesterification of soapberry oil and methanol. The structures of the prepared ILs were systematically characterized by both Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR, 1H NMR and 13C NMR). In addition, the effects of side-chain length of cation and the number of active site (H+) of ILs on the biodiesel yield were investigated, and the results suggested that 1-dodecyl-(4-dimethylammonium)-pyridinium bisulfate ([C12-DMAPH][HSO4]2) exhibited the highest catalytic efficiency. Meanwhile, [C12-DMAPH][HSO4]2 was proven to be amphipathic, and the corresponding catalytic mechanism was proposed. Under the catalysis of [C12-DMAPH][HSO4]2, the optimum operating conditions of transesterification of soapberry oil and methanol were explored via the combination of single factor experiment and response surface methodology, obtaining the high biodiesel yield of (98.02 ± 0.36)% under the optimum operating conditions. Importantly, [C12-DMAPH][HSO4]2 exhibited high stability in the transesterification of soapberry oil and methanol in five consecutive runs. Furthermore, the catalytic activities of [C12-DMAPH][HSO4]2 towards other transesterification of non-edible oils and lower alcohols were also investigated, which indicated a general applicability of the prepared IL. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","4-Dimethylaminopyridine; Amphipathic ionic liquids; Biodiesel; Soapberry oil; Transesterification","Biodiesel; Catalysis; Catalyst activity; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Ionic liquids; Methanol; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Quantum chemistry; Synthetic fuels; Transesterification; 4-dimethylaminopyridine; Biodiesel production; Both Fourier Transform Infrared; Catalytic efficiencies; Number of active sites; Optimum operating conditions; Response surface methodology; Single-factor experiments; Petroleum industry; biofuel; catalysis; catalyst; experimental study; methanol; response surface methodology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098881161

The transesterification process is the most popular method for biodiesel production from various sources, categorized as first, second and third generation biodiesel depending on the source. The transesterification process is subject to a variety of factors that can be taken into account to improve biodiesel yield. One of the factors is catalyst type and concentration, which plays a significant role in the transesterification of biodiesel sources. At present, chemical and biological catalysts are being investigated and each catalyst has its advantages and disadvantages. Recently, nanocatalysts have drawn researchers’ attention to the efficient production of biodiesel. This article discusses recent work on the role of several nanocatalysts in the transesterification reaction of various sources in the development of biodiesel. A large number of literature from highly rated journals in scientific indexes is reviewed, including the most recent publications. Most of the authors reported that nanocatalysts show an important influence regarding activity and selectivity. This study highlights that in contrast to conventional catalysts, the highly variable surface area of nanostructure materials favours interaction between catalysts and substrates that efficiently boost the performance of products.

Herein, surface CoFeOx-decorated bimetallic CoFe catalysts were developed via a Co-Mg-Fe layered double hydroxide precursor strategy and utilized for the transfer hydrogenolysis of 5-hydromethylfurfural (HMF) into 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) with the help of formic acid as the sustainable hydrogen donor. The as-fabricated CoFe bimetallic catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic performance with a high yield of DMF (>92%). Contrarily, monometallic Co-based catalyst delivered a much lower DMF yield. The structural characterizations and catalytic experiments demonstrated that the catalytic behavior of bimetallic CoFe catalysts was correlated with the appropriate combination of highly dispersed bimetallic metallic nanoparticles and abundant oxygen vacancies originating from surface CoFeOx species, as well as favorable surface basic sites, thereby facilitating the dehydrogenation of formic acid and improving the affinity for carbonyl reduction, which promoted the selective hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis of carbonyl or hydroxymethyl group in HMF and reaction intermediates. Furthermore, excellent structural advantages of as-fabricated CoFe catalyst, such as high alloying degree of CoFe and strong metal-support interactions, endowed it with good stability and regeneration performance.

CDU's future depends on the future demand for carbon-derived products; among them, formic acid is an excellent candidate due to its distinctive characteristics as a hydrogen carrier in liquid form. It is non-toxic that can be used in hydrogen fuel cells, and its significant potential in the heavy oil and biofuel refining process as a hydrogen-carrier substance. This research aims to use Energy, Exergy, Exergoeconomic, and exergoenvironmental (4E) analysis to evaluate the impact of anolyte material on the efficiency of the electrochemical reduction process to synthesis formic acid (in the term of six new anolyte materials). Results show that the second scenario (IrO2 single circulation mode) is the best option for the power plant. Implementing this CDU system reduces the carbon capture of about 75.20 kg/s or about 89% of the power plant's overall carbon emission. This process's energy penalty can be adequately provided by the PV, which causes greater exergy efficiency and decreases the power plant's energy performance rate. Moreover, the use of IrO2 anolyte is decreased the exergy rate cost and the flow rate cost to the 0.21 $/kWh and 2.280×10-2 $/s. The CDU's investment cost using the DSA/O2 anolyte is 28% decreased compared to the KOH anolyte and reached 7.2 million USD for the CO2 utilization plant. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","4E analysis; Carbon dioxide utilization; Electrochemical reduction; Exergoeconomic analysis; Formic acid; Solar fuel","Biofuels; Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Climate change; Crude oil; Electrolytic reduction; Exergy; Formic acid; Fuel cells; Heavy oil production; Hydrogen; Iridium compounds; Petroleum refining; Potassium hydroxide; Power plants; Carbon dioxide utilization; Critical approach; Electrochemical reductions; Energy penalties; Energy performance; Exergy efficiencies; Hydrogen carriers; Investment costs; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100736056

Because of its water insolubility, high boiling point, and high energy density, DMF seems to be a promising liquid biofuel. Selective hydrogenation of biomass-derived 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-DMF can be achieved using novel catalysts and is presented here. In this study, a series of Al-Zr mixed oxide catalysts (AZMO) were prepared by co-precipitation and hydrothermal techniques. AZMO catalyst prepared by the co-precipitation method gave higher acidity and surface area. Furthermore, mono and bimetallic M/AZMOCP (M = Ni, Co, Cu, and Pd) catalysts were developed by the impregnation and used for hydrogenation of HMF. The catalytic activity was found in the order of: 2%Pd-5%Co/AZMOCP &gt; 1%Pd-5%Co/AZMOCP &gt; 2%Pd-3%Co/AZMOCP &gt; 1%Pd-3%Co/AZMOCP &gt; 5%Ni-5%Co/AZMOCP &gt; 1%Pd/AZMOCP &gt; 5%Co/AZMOCP &gt; 5%Cu-5%Co/AZMOCP &gt; 3%Co/AZMOCP. It was found that 2%Pd-5%Co/AZMOCP resulted in complete conversion of HMF with 97% yield of DMF at 100 °C and 10 atm H2 pressure. The catalysts were characterized by sophisticated techniques such as FESEM, EDS, XRD, NH3-TPD, ATR-FTIR, BET analysis, HRTEM, TPR, XPS and TGA-DSC.

In the present study, nanoclusters of Ru0-Pd0 that self-assemble into spherical-like Ru-Pd bimetallic catalytic sites were successfully grown on the surfaces of BN nanosheets (Ru-Pd/BN NCs) via microwave irradiation for 30 s. HR-TEM investigations revealed the formation of 25 nm sized Ru-Pd nanoparticles comprising ≤ 2 nm hexagonal closed-pack (hcp) Ru-Pd clusters with Ru crystallites on the BN nanosheets. Further, furfural was effectively converted into furfural alcohol at a lower temperature (150 °C) and valuable cyclopentanone was obtained at a higher temperature (&gt;250 °C) over the Ru-Pd/BN catalyst through the protonation of water molecules. Furthermore, various solvents namely 2-propanol, toluene, and cyclohexane were also used to achieve the production of furan and tetrahydrofuran over the Ru-Pd/BN catalyst via the decarbonylation of furfural under mild reaction conditions. Moreover, for real-time upgrading, furfural-rich bio-oil produced by the pyrolysis of date-tree biomass was processed over the Ru-Pd/BN catalyst to obtain a maximum of 97% furfural conversion with a 71% FFA yield at 150 °C. The stability and reusability of the catalyst were also determined. The results demonstrated that the Ru-Pd/BN catalyst is highly active and chemically stable, and is therefore suitable for industrial applications. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bimetallic alloy; Bio-oil hydrogenation; Boron nitride; Functional catalyst; Furfural hydrogenation","Aldehydes; Binary alloys; Boron nitride; Catalyst activity; Catalyst selectivity; Crystallites; Furfural; III-V semiconductors; Microwave irradiation; Molecules; Nanocatalysts; Nanoparticles; Nanosheets; Nitrides; Organic solvents; Protonation; Reusability; Boron nitride nanosheets; Decarbonylations; Furfural alcohol; Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN); Lower temperatures; Mild reaction conditions; PD nano particle; Tetra-hydrofuran; Palladium alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097800960

The key point for the industrial manufacturing of biodiesel is its cost, especially the price of raw oil feedstocks. Oil feedstocks of low quality require highly effective catalysts with more active sites (e.g., acid, base, acid-base, and enzyme) for (trans)esterification. Metal-organic framework (MOF) is a kind of polyporous material that can control its pore size and topological structure to fit the requirements of the catalytic reactions or conversion routes. This review focuses on the application of MOF-based catalysts in the preparation of biodiesel. Two methods of linking the active sites with MOF are introduced including intermolecular forces and chemical bridging or bonding. Four kinds of MOF-based nanocatalysts (i.e., enzyme, base, acid, and bifunctional catalysts) are evaluated and compared with other heterogeneous catalysts. Besides, technologies such as ultrasound and microwave for MOF-based nanocatalyst applications to produce biodiesel through transesterification and esterification are described. Finally, a brief conclusion and perspective for MOF-based nanocatalyst that applies to biodiesel production are provided.

Characterization results indicate that ceria and Co species facilitate the distribution of each other due to the formation of a Ce-O-Co solid solution. The specific surface area of the catalyst increased from 378.77 to 537.7 m2g−1viathe introduction of ceria. The electron transfer from Co to Ce further enhanced their interaction, and Co species facilitate the formation of more defective oxygen vacancies on ceria, which are beneficial to the activities of catalytic hydrogenation and catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH), respectively. Thus, Co/Ce@NC (0.99% Co loading) pyrolyzed at 850 °C exhibits excellent performance in the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of vanillin with high metal utilization.

We report a highly efficient, chemoselective, and reusable single-site nickel(II) hydride catalyst based on robust and porous aluminum metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) (DUT-5) for hydrogenation of nitro and nitrile compounds to the corresponding amines and hydrogenolysis of aryl ethers under mild conditions. The nickel-hydride catalyst was prepared by the metalation of aluminum hydroxide secondary building units (SBUs) of DUT-5 having the formula of Al(μ2-OH)(bpdc) (bpdc = 4,4′-biphenyldicarboxylate) with NiBr2 followed by a reaction with NaEt3BH. DUT-5-NiH has a broad substrate scope with excellent functional group tolerance in the hydrogenation of aromatic and aliphatic nitro and nitrile compounds under 1 bar H2 and could be recycled and reused at least 10 times. By changing the reaction conditions of the hydrogenation of nitriles, symmetric or unsymmetric secondary amines were also afforded selectively. The experimental and computational studies suggested reversible nitrile coordination to nickel followed by 1,2-insertion of coordinated nitrile into the nickel-hydride bond occurring in the turnover-limiting step. In addition, DUT-5-NiH is also an active catalyst for chemoselective hydrogenolysis of carbon-oxygen bonds in aryl ethers to afford hydrocarbons under atmospheric hydrogen in the absence of any base, which is important for the generation of fuels from biomass.

Engineering the co-catalyst at atom level has recently been proposed to increase the photocatalytic efficiency. Here, we report a new strategy for preparing highly stable single-atom photocatalysts containing abundant isolated atomic sites. We used oxygen vacancies (Vos) to confine Pt atoms and to produce single-atom photocatalysts, labeled Pt0.254/black TiO2, that are more efficient and more stable. Results show that Pt atoms are mainly located on surface oxygen vacancies and are rather uniformly distributed on the surface of black TiO2 at a concentration of 0.254 wt %. The single-atom photocatalyst displayed excellent catalytic efficiency and stability for hydrogen generation and phenol decomposition. Overall, our findings propose an alternative method to fabricate and engineer single-atom photocatalysts. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Black TiO2; Decomposition; Hydrogen evolution; Photocatalytic; Pt single atom",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098541964

The selectivity of (cyclopentylmethyl)cyclohexane formed by isomerization is enhanced through inhibiting the quick hydrogenation of intermediates using mixing acid catalyst and metal catalyst. Zeolite with strong Brønsted acid site and big surface area, such as HZSM-5 is better for the isomerization.

Enhancement of the biomass and metabolite production of microalgae increases the economic feasibility of the biofuel production process. The present study encompasses on bioethanol production from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii through a biorefinery approach. The biomass and carbohydrate productivity of C. reinhardtii UTEX 90 and CC 2656 were enhanced by optimizing the physico-chemical parameters. The following conditions were found suitable for the improvement of biomass and metabolite content of C. reinhardtii: pH 6.5–7.0, incubation temperature 30 °C, initial acetate and ammonium chloride concentration of 1.56 g L−1 and 100–200 mg L−1, respectively. Under the optimized operational condition biomass and carbohydrate productivity of C. reinhardtii UTEX 90 and CC 2656 were 512 mg L−1 d−1 &amp; 266.24 mg L−1 d−1 and 364 mg L−1 d −1 &amp; 163.80 mg L−1 d−1, respectively. The amount of CO2 sequestered during the cultivation process by UTEX 90 and CC 2656 were 113 mg L−1 d−1 and 74.95 mg L−1 d−1, respectively. The depigmented and defatted carbohydrate rich biomass was considered as raw material for bioethanol production. The bioethanol yield range was 90–94% of the theoretical yield using Saccharomyces cerevisiae INVSC-1 in a double jacket reactor. To improve the viability of the process, the spent media after ethanol fermentation was subsequently used for methane production using mixed microbial consortium. The energy recovery from the process was 40.39% and 39.7% for UTEX 90 and CC 2656, respectively when C. reinhardtii biomass was used as substrate for biofuel production.

Recently, significant interest has been directed towards the selective hydrogenolysis of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to produce biofuel 2, 5-dimethylfuran (DMF). In this study, non-noble Ni–Cu catalysts with various Ni/Cu ratios, supported on titanium silicalite-1 (TS-1), were prepared through a solid-phase grinding method and used to catalyze the hydrogenolysis of HMF to DMF under a hydrogen atmosphere. The structure and surface morphology of the catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared, thermogravimetry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia, scanning electron microscopy, and N2 adsorption-desorption techniques. Under the optimized reaction conditions, the conversion of HMF and the selectivity for DMF over a 40%Ni–5%Cu/TS-1 catalyst could reach 100.0% and 97.3%, respectively. Importantly, because the strong interaction of the Ni–Cu alloy structure prevents further reaction of the furan ring, almost no by-products are produced. The metal sites of Ni and Cu and the acid sites of TS-1 combine to provide a synergistic effect, which is beneficial to the hydrogenolysis of HMF. In addition, reusability experiments showed that the catalyst maintained good activity and stability. © 2020","2,5-Dimethylfuran; 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural; Bimetallic catalyst; Biomass transformation; Selective hydrogenolysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117071222

Herein, for the first time, we have sequentially synthesized silver-cobalt core-shell nanoalloy-based catalysts through a simple wet impregnation method for selective conversion of LA to GVL. The highest catalytic proficiency (97.3 LA conversion with 100% GVL selectivity) had been achieved over a composition-graded optimized catalyst, named 5Ag-15Co, under comparatively moderate reaction conditions (150 °C, 1 MPa H2 pressure). The catalyst structure-activity relationship has been established through an extensive range of in situ spectroscopic characterizations, which included in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), in situ CO-diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy, and in situ attenuated total reflection-inferred (ATR-IR) spectroscopy. The extraordinary catalytic activity could be attributed to the modulation of electronic properties, which is mainly due to the synergistic interaction in the core-shell alloy system, as confirmed from in situ XPS studies. The presence of the highest amount of metallic cobalt in the 5Ag-15Co catalyst, which was evidenced by both in situ XPS and in situ CO-DRIFT, could assist the hydrogenation step in hydrodeoxygenation of LA to GVL. This finding also was emphasized by H2 chemisorption analysis, which revealed the presence of the highest active metal surface area in the 5Ag-15Co catalyst. In situ ATR-IR has elucidated that moderate interaction, which was generated between the catalyst and LA, has enhanced the rate of reaction.

These environmental aspects along with the energy demand have motivated the search for new energy systems. In this context, biofuels such as biodiesel have been developing into a substitute for conventional fuels. Microalgae are considered a promising option for biodiesel production due to their high lipid content. Therefore, it is important to analyze the technical aspects of the biodiesel production system. In this work, the inherent safety analysis of three emerging topologies for biodiesel production from microalgae was performed using the inherent safety index (ISI) methodology. Selected topologies include biodiesel production via lipid extraction and transesterification, in-situ transesterification, and hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). The results revealed that the processes are inherently unsafe achieving total inherent safety index scores of 30, 29, and 36. The main risks in the cases were associated with the chemical safety index. Operating conditions represented no risk for topologies 1 and 2, while for topology 3 pressure and temperature were identified as critical variables. In general, topology 2 showed better performance from a safety perspective. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, in the first stage, the starchy wastewater (SWW) with poultry manure (PM) was treated to produce a maximum hydrogen yield of 4.11 mol H2/Kg COD reduced to 5.03 mol H2/Kg COD reduced. The reutilization of soluble spent wash for the cultivation of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii yielded a biomass concentration of 1.45–1.02 g/L. The potentiality of algae to produce biodiesel was checked effectively, and it was reported that a biodiesel of 90.34 g/Kg Algal Biomass to 119.61 g/Kg Algal was yielded.

In the first step, zinc‑iron magnetic nanocatalyst supported on activated carbon (ZnO-Fe3O4/AC) was prepared for the selective hydrogenation of HMF into BHMF and 5-MFA via Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reaction in three different hydrogen donor alcohols (ethanol, 1-propanol, and 1-butanol). The important physical properties of the catalyst such as crystallinity, chemical composition, morphology, reduction behavior, and surface area were studied by using several analytical techniques. The effect of hydrogenation parameters such as catalyst concentration, temperature, and time on the selectivity of (BHMF and 5-MFA), and HMF conversion were studied. The best hydrogenation results were obtained with 0.2 mmole HMF and 100 mg of catalyst at 200 °C for 12 h.

The consumption of fossil fuels is an example, with increasing levels of exploitation and negative impacts caused by their use. Anthropogenic activities have triggered the over accumulation of many hazardous substances and wastes which are regarded to be detrimental to life in the Earth and to the various planet ecosystems. There is an urgent need to restore natural resources and unwanted residues and wastes to levels prior the demographic explosion. Microalgal biotechnology appears to be pivotal to achieve this goal in a near future to come. This review presents the current resource problems affecting the Earth and how microalgae are expected to be an important part of the solution, discussing how the production of renewable energy from microalgae can help in an integrated way to mitigate different environmental problems.

Thus, biodiesel has been recognized as a potential alternative to petrodiesel for its biodegradability, non-toxicity, and environment-friendly attributes. In this study, an efficient and recyclable Cu–Ni doped ZrO2 catalyst was synthesized and used to produce biodiesel from a novel non-edible caper (Capparis spinosa L.) seed oil. The synthesized catalyst was characterized by x-ray diffraction, fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive x-ray analysis. The catalyst was reused in four consecutive transesterification reactions without losing any significant catalytic efficiency. Transesterification reaction conditions were optimized via response surface methodology based on Box-Behnken design for predicting optimum biodiesel yields by drawing 3D surface plots. Maximum biodiesel yield of 90.2% was obtained under optimal operating conditions of 1:6 M ratio of oil to methanol, reaction temperature of 70 °C, reaction time of 1.5 h, and 2.5% catalyst loading. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance (1H and 13C) analysis confirmed the high quality of biodiesel produced from non-edible caper (Capparis spinosa L.) seed oil. The fuel properties of the produced biodiesel were also found, such as kinematic viscosity (4.17 cS T), density (0.8312 kg/L), flash point (72 °C), acid no (0.21 mgKOH/g) and sulphur content (0.00042 wt%). These properties were matched and are in close agreement with the International Biodiesel Standards of European Union (EU-14214), China GB/T 20,828 (2007), and American (ASTM6751). Thus, non-edible Capparis spinosa L. seed oil and Cu–Ni doped ZrO2 catalyst appeared to be highly active, stable, and cheap candidates to boost the future biodiesel industry. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bioenergy; Biofuel; Box-behnken design; Capparis spinosa L; Renewable energy; Sustainable energy; Transesterification","Biodegradability; Biodiesel; Catalysts; Copper compounds; Energy dispersive X ray analysis; Fossil fuel deposits; Fossil fuels; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Gas chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Nickel compounds; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Oils and fats; Quality control; Renewable energy resources; Scanning electron microscopy; Transesterification; X ray diffraction analysis; Zirconia; Catalytic efficiencies; Environment friendly; Fossil fuel resources; Optimal operating conditions; Reaction temperature; Renewable energy source; Response surface methodology; Transesterification reaction; Synthetic fuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096192736

We consider how the electrochemical reactor impacts the manufacturing costs for producing biofuel and determine a break-even value for the lignin oxidation product stream, which is the minimum lignin conversion product stream value that renders the cost to produce biofuel the same as in the typical biorefinery concept. We conclude that at low extents of lignin conversion, the break-even product stream value is likely too high for the process to be feasible. However, at higher extents of lignin conversion, the break-even product stream value may be between $1.00 and $2.00/kg, depending on capital cost and other manufacturing costs like depreciation. Potential markets for the biomass conversion products include resin manufacturing, where the products would compete with petroleum-derived resin precursors. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Biorefinery; Conversion; Economics; Electrochemical; Lignin","Bioconversion; Biofuels; Economic analysis; Industrial chemicals; Lignin; Lignocellulosic biomass; Petroleum industry; Refining; Resins; Biomass conversion; Biorefinery concept; Electrochemical reactor; Lignin oxidation; Manufacturing cost; Potential markets; Product streams; Techno-Economic analysis; Industrial economics; biofuel; hydrogen; industrial chemical; lignin; lignocellulose; resin; biofuel; hydrogen; lignin; lignocellulose; Article; biomass conversion; capital; controlled study; current density; economics; electricity; electrochemistry; energy; energy consumption; flow rate; hydrogen evolution; oxidation; oxygen evolution; techno economic analysis; ultraviolet spectroscopy; chemistry; electrochemical analysis; Chemicals; Conversion; Economic Analysis; Hydrogen; Operating Costs; Products; Refining; Biofuels; Electrochemical Techniques; Hydrogen; Lignin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096011297

Among them, furfural alcohol derived from biomass resources has been found to be one of the most prospective biomass platforms for high-value chemicals and biofuels. Herein, high-surface-area ZrO2 with abundant oxygen defects and surface acid-base sites was synthesized and used as a heterogeneous catalyst for the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of furfural into furfural alcohol using alcohol as a hydrogen donor. The as-synthesized ZrO2 exhibited excellent catalytic performance with 98.2% FA conversion and 97.1% FOL selectivity, even comparable with that of a homogeneous Lewis acid catalyst. A series of characterization studies and experimental results revealed that acid sites on the surface of ZrO2 could adsorb and activate the CO bond in furfural and base sites could facilitate the formation of alkoxide species. The synergistic effect of surface acid-base sites affords a harmonious environment for the reaction, which is crucial for catalytic transfer hydrogenation of furfural with high efficiency. Furthermore, the as-prepared ZrO2 catalyst also exhibited a potential application for the efficient catalytic transfer hydrogenation of a series of biomass-derived carbonyl compounds.

The influences of feedstocks blending ratio on the characteristics of bio-oil and CNTs were established. The reaction mechanism of carbon deposition during the system was also probed. The results showed that co-feeding plastic to biomass siginificantly enhanced the selectivity of monoaromatics (benzene, toluene, and xylene) from 5.6% for pure biomass to the maximum yield of 44.4% for 75.0% plastic ratio, and decreased naphthalene and its derivates from 85.9 to 41.7% correspondingly. The most synergistic effect on BTX selectivity occurred at 25% of plastic ratio. The multi-walled CNTs were successfully synethsized on Ni catalyst by utilizing prolysis gas as feedstocks. For pure biomass, the least CNTs yield with ultrafine diameters of 3.9–8.5 nm was generated via disproportionation reaction of CO which was derived from decarboxylation and decarbonylation of oxygenates on the ZSM-5 acid sites. With the rise of plastic ratio, sufficient hydrocarbons were produced for CNTs growth, endowing CNTs with long and straight tube walls, along with uniform diameters (~16 nm). The CNTs yield increased as high as 139 mg/g-cata. In addition, the decreased CO2 inhibited dry reforming with C1-C4 hydrocarbons and deposited carbon, avoiding excessive etching of CNTs. Thereby, high-purity CNTs with less defects were fabricated when plastic ratio was beyond 50% in the feedstock. The strategy is expected to improve the sustainability and economic viability of biomass pyrolysis. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Aromatics-rich bio-oil; Biomass; Carbon nanotubes; Catalytic co-pyrolysis; Plastic","Biomass; Blending; Carboxylation; Etching; Feedstocks; Hydrocarbons; Naphthalene; Pyrolysis; Benzene , toluene , and xylenes; Carbon deposition; Carbon nano-materials; Catalytic upgrading; Disproportionation reactions; Economic viability; Reaction mechanism; Synergistic effect; Carbon nanotubes; benzene; carbon nanoparticle; hydrocarbon; multi walled nanotube; naphthalene; nitrogen; plastic; toluene; xylene; Bio-Oil; biofuel; carbon nanotube; polyphenol; vegetable oil; biomass; carbon nanotube; catalysis; integrated approach; plastic waste; pyrolysis; synergism; Article; biomass; catalysis; chemical reaction; decarboxylation; nanofabrication; particle size; plastic waste; priority journal; pyrolysis; synthesis; biomass; catalysis; heat; Biofuels; Biomass; Catalysis; Hot Temperature; Nanotubes, Carbon; Plant Oils; Plastics; Polyphenols; Pyrolysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098061890

The key waste-to-energy technologies discussed in this review include conventional thermal incineration and the modern hydrothermal incineration. The thermochemical treatments (e.g. pyrolysis, liquefaction and gasification) and biological treatments (e.g. anaerobic digestion and composting) are also elaborated for the transformation of solid wastes to biofuel products. The current status of municipal solid waste management for effective disposal and diversion along with the opportunities and challenges has been comprehensively reviewed.

Reviewing the current technology, there is still reluctance in investing towards the production of new algal strains that yield more oil and maximize capital gains. In the current work, the microalgal feedstock selection problem is investigated for increased lipid production and nano-catalytic conversion into clean biofuel. For that purpose, a variety of Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Decision Making processes and a multitude of Optimization criteria spanning to technological, environmental, economic, and social aspects are used. The strains selected for the analysis are Chlorella sp., Schizochytrium sp., Spirulina sp., and Nannochloropsis sp. The methods applied are fuzzy analytic hierarchy process, FTOPSIS (fuzzy technique for the order of preference to the ideal solution), and FCM (fuzzy cognitive mapping). Pairwise comparison matrices were calculated using data from extensive literature review. All aforementioned fuzzy logic methodologies are proven superior to their numeric equivalent under uncertain factors that affect the decision making, such as cost, policy implications, and also geographical and seasonal variation. A major finding is that the most dominant factor in the strain selection is the high lipid content. Moreover, the results indicate that the Chlorella Vulgaris microalgae is ranked as the best choice by the FTOPSIS method followed by the Nannochloropsis strain, and Spirulina Platensis was found to be the last in performance. The best and worst case scenario run with FCM experimentally verify this choice indicating that Chlorella Vulgaris follows this trend of selection mostly with the technological and the economic criteria for both the sigmoid and the hyperbolic tangent deep-learning functions used. © Copyright © 2021 Kokkinos, Karayannis and Moustakas.","biofuel; clean energy; conversion; feedstock selection; fuzzy multi-criteria decision making; microalgal biomass; nanocatalyst; optimization","Algae; Biofuels; Decision making; Deep learning; Feedstocks; Hyperbolic functions; Microorganisms; Oils and fats; Public policy; Social aspects; Catalytic conversion; Fuzzy - Multi criteria decision making; Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process; Fuzzy cognitive mappings; Fuzzy logic methodology; High lipid contents; Optimization criteria; Pairwise comparison matrices; Fuzzy logic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100893845

The partially hydrotreated palm-BDF (denoted as H-FAME) which has low poly-FAME components is a new type of BDF with enhanced quality for use in high blends. In this study, we reported that the chemical states and particle sizes of Pd in the prepared Pd/AC catalysts were significantly influenced by the Pd precursors, Pd(NO3)2 and Pd(NH3)4Cl2, and thus varied their hydrogenation activity and product selectivity. The 1%Pd/AC (nit) catalyst, prepared using Pd(NO3)2, presented high performance for selective hydrogenation of poly-FAME into mono-FAME with high oxidation stability, owning to its large Pd particles (8.4 nm). Conversely, the 1%Pd/AC (amc) cata-lyst, prepared using Pd(NH3)4Cl2, contained small Pd particles (2.7 nm) with a little Cl residues, which could be completely removed by washing with an aqueous solution of 0.1 M NH4OH. The small Pd particles gave increased selectivity toward unwanted-FAME components, particularly the saturated fatty acid methyl esters during the hydrogenation of poly-FAME.

Biofuel, especially biodiesel, has become a feasible substitute for petroleum diesel as it can be directly used in existing transport infrastructure without significant alteration. This paper starts by discussing some critical physicochemical properties and their effect on engine performance and emission. The research then proposes a ranking scheme to select the most suitable biodiesel based on six vital physicochemical properties: density, viscosity, heating value, flash point, cetane number and oxidation stability. The solution developed is independent of supervision, contrary to popular learning algorithms and can operate on the only intelligence whether an attribute is favourable by its higher/lower values. The novelty of the work consists in ensuring that the rarer properties pick up the greater weights and in establishing a simple ranker based on descriptive statistics. This scheme first generates transactions against each biodiesel which helps in association rule mining, which is later used to score/rank the biodiesels. The three phases and their subordinate sub-steps have been carried out using the platforms: Python, R and Tableau, respectively. The study endorses Brassica juncea, Cardoon (Cynara cardunculu), and poppyseed oil as the most desirable biodiesel feedstocks. On the other hand, cedar, castor and hiptage were ranked as least desirable in the list of 71 feedstocks based on the proposed ranking scheme. The proposed ranking scheme will help decision-makers such to analyze and obtain tailored biodiesel feedstock for their purposes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiesel; Biodiesel Ranking; Engine emission; Engine performance; Physicochemical properties","Carbon footprint; Decision making; Environmental impact; Feedstocks; Fossil fuel deposits; Fossil fuels; Learning algorithms; Nuclear fuels; Petroleum transportation; Physicochemical properties; Proven reserves; Renewable energy resources; Biodiesel feedstock; Descriptive statistics; Energy dependence; Engine performance; Fossil fuel utilization; Oxidation stability; Petroleum diesel; Transport infrastructure; Biodiesel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097635530

The maximum biodiesel yield of 83% was obtained by base catalyzed transesterification process under optimum operating conditions of methanol to oil ratio of 15:1, reaction temperature of 150 °C, reaction time of 5 h and catalyst loading of 3.5%. The synthesized catalyst and biodiesel were characterized for their structural features and chemical compositions using various state-of-the-art techniques, including x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (1H, 13C) and gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. The fuel properties of the biodiesel were estimated including kinematic viscosity (4.36 cSt), density (0.8312 kg/L), flash point (72 °C), acid value (0.172 mgKOH/g) and sulphur content (0.0002 wt.%). These properties were compared and found in good agreement with the International Biodiesel Standards of American (ASTM-951, 6751), European Committee (EN-14214) and China GB/T 20828 (2007). The catalyst was re-used in five consecutive transesterification reactions without losing much catalytic efficiency.

The level of freshwater is reducing which has pushed the society to reuse/recycle wastewater. Eco-friendly and economically sound treatment of industrial wastewater has attracted global attention and hence is a thrust area of research. Organic compounds rich wastewater can be used to generate bioenergy and value-added products from the resource recovery point of view. Wastewater treatment(s) can be used to trap energy from industrial effluents in form of biofuel, bioenergy and biogas. Recovered products can be used in various ways such as recovered nutrients for (bio)fertilizer production and algal biomass for bioplastic production. Microbial electrochemical technology is a promising approach for resource recovery. This review article aims to present and discuss trends and scientific developments about recovery of value-added products from dye industry effluent. It also provides state-of-art technical information about technologies for remediation of pollutants from dye industry effluent with emphasis on nanotechnological approaches and microbial electrochemical technologies (METs).

Biodiesel production becomes cheaper when we use a cheap precursor, eco-friendly catalyst and a proper process. Pig tallow from the meat industry containing high fatty acid can be utilized as an effective precursor for biodiesel preparation. This study produced biodiesel from pig tallow oil via ultrasonic assisted and CuO catalysed two-step esterification process. Cinnamomum tamala (C. tamala) extract was utilized for CuO nanoparticles preparation and characterized using infra-red spectra, x-ray diffraction, particle size distribution, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Biodiesel production was modelled using Box-Behnken design (BBD) and artificial neural network (ANN), in the variables range of ultrasonication (US) time (20–40 min), CuO nanocatalyst load (1–3 wt%), and the methanol to pre-treated PTO molar ratio (10:1–30:1). Statistical analysis proved that the ANN modelling was better than BBD. Optimal yield of 97.82% obtained using Genetic Algorithm (GA) at US time: 35.36 min, CuO catalyst load: 2.07 wt%, and the molar ratio: 29.87:1. Comparison with previous studies proved that ultrasonication significantly reduced the CuO nanocatalyst load, and increased the molar ratio and improved the process. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Copper oxide; Green synthesis; Neural network; Pig tallow; Response surface; Ultrasonic","Biodiesel; Copper oxides; Fatty acids; Fossil fuels; Genetic algorithms; Green manufacturing; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Mammals; Molar ratio; Nanocatalysts; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Scanning electron microscopy; Biodiesel preparation; Biodiesel production; Boxbehnken design (BBD); Cinnamomum tamala; CuO nanoparticles; Meat industry wastes; Neural network modelling; Scanning and transmission electron microscopy; Neural networks; agricultural emission; alternative energy; artificial neural network; biofuel; catalyst; copper; design method; fatty acid; particle size; pig; ultrasonics; Cinnamomum tamala; Suidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091785135

In this study, we describe fabrication and characterization of sensitive biosensors for the detection of ethanol and glucose based on new micro/nanocomposite electrodes with peroxidase-like activity (nanozyme) coupled with microbial oxidases: alcohol oxidase (AOX) and glucose oxidase (GOX). The nanozyme was synthesized by modification of carbon microfibers (CF) by hemin (H) and gold (Au) nanoparticles. The formation of gold nanoparticles on the surface of hemin-modified carbon microfibers has been confirmed by the UV–Vis and X-ray spectroscopy as well by the SEM analysis. Compared to hemin-only modified electrodes, the resulting micro/nanocomposite CF-H-Au electrodes exhibit a higher specific catalytic activity and a better affinity for H2O2 in solution. The H2O2-sensitive CF-H-Au-modified electrodes showed a higher sensitivity (1.3–2.6-fold) compared with the nearest carbon-derived analogs and were used for the construction of highly sensitive ethanol and glucose biosensors. To eliminate diffusion limitation for substrates, AOX or GOX were fixed on the CF-H-Au-modified electrodes using a highly porous Nafion membrane. The main biosensors’ characteristics have been investigated. The developed biosensors were tested for ethanol and glucose analysis in the real samples of both grape must and wine.

The distance (0.98 nm) between Ni active sites within Ni-BTC structure, which was much larger than that (0.20 nm) within Ni nanoparticles, enabled methyl palmitate with maximum molecule width of 0.68 nm to go through Ni-BTC crystalline plane and get access to Ni active sites more easily.

With the largest BET surface area of 1014.2 m2/g, the Ni-BTC@MCM-41 catalyst with 2.5 wt% nickel (2.5Ni-BTC@MCM-41) reduced the nickel metal consumption by 75% comparing to nickel nanoparticle loading (10Ni@MCM-41), but achieved the best catalytic performances through hydrodeoxygenation on Ni active sites and hydrocracking on -SiOH acid sites.

The materials were characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy coupled with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy system for elemental mapping, thermogravimetry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, low temperature N2 adsorption, vibratory sample magnetometry and acid-base titration. The best yield obtained in the esterification reaction was for the acai seed sample and red mud in a 1:1 ratio, carbonized at 400 °C for 3 h and sulfonated at 80 °C for 3 h.

Notably, the synthesized CuO NPs are used as a heterogeneous catalyst in the biodiesel production. The synthesized CuO NPs are characterized using XRD, FTIR, FESEM, BET, Zeta potential, DLS and UV–visible absorption spectroscopy. The obtained results showed the monoclinic crystal structure of CuO with rod-like morphology with diameter of around 100 nm. The CuO NPs were successfully utilized for the biodiesel synthesis using T. chebula oil as feedstock by varying the reaction parameters.

To this end, this article summarizes the current status of several key technical steps during microbial biodiesel production, including (1) acidogenic fermentation of bio-wastes for VFA collection, (2) lipid accumulation in oleaginous microorganisms, (3) microbial lipid extraction, (4) transesterification of microbial lipids into crude biodiesel, and (5) crude biodiesel purification. The emerging membrane-based bioprocesses such as electrodialysis, forward osmosis and membrane distillation, are promising approaches as they could help tackle technical challenges related to the separation and recovery of VFAs from the fermentation broth. The genetic engineering and metabolic engineering approaches could be applied to design microbial species with higher lipid productivity and rapid growth rate for enhanced fatty acids synthesis. The enhanced in situ transesterification technologies aided by microwave, ultrasound and supercritical solvents are also recommended for future research. Technical limitations and cost-effectiveness of microbial biodiesel production from bio-wastes are also discussed, in regard to its potential industrial development. Based on the overview on microbial biodiesel technologies, an integrated biodiesel production line incorporating all the critical technical steps is proposed for unified management and continuous optimization for highly efficient biodiesel production. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Acidogenic fermentation; Biorefinery; Microbial lipids; Transesterification; Volatile fatty acids","Cost effectiveness; Dialysis membranes; Distillation; Fermentation; Genetic engineering; Growth rate; Lipids; Metabolic engineering; Microorganisms; Optimization; Transesterification; Volatile fatty acids; Wastes; Acidogenic fermentation; Continuous optimization; Industrial development; Metabolic engineering approach; Oleaginous microorganisms; Situ transesterification; Supercritical solvents; Volatile fatty acids (VFAs); Biodiesel; biodiesel; lipid; volatile fatty acid; biofuel; bioaccumulation; biofuel; distillation; extraction method; fermentation; genetic engineering; industrial waste; lipid; membrane; microbial activity; reverse osmosis; separation; Article; bacterium; biofuel production; bioprocess; carbon source; cost effectiveness analysis; distillation; electrodialysis; extraction; fatty acid synthesis; fermentation; genetic engineering; industrial waste; lipid storage; metabolic engineering; microorganism; microwave radiation; nonhuman; organic waste; osmosis; purification; scale up; transesterification; ultrasound; esterification; Biofuels; Esterification; Fermentation; Industrial Waste; Metabolic Engineering",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088786920

Despite the growth prospects for this sector, there are several difficulties related to the use of biodiesel in combustion engines. Hydroprocessed diesel or green diesel is a viable alternative of renewable biofuel to complement the conventional diesel production; it presents several technical and economic advantages over the biodiesel produced through the transesterification process. Therefore, the purpose of this work was to gather technical information about green diesel, compare it to biodiesel, and analyze the potential of introducing this biofuel to the energy production in Brazil as a substitute or a complementary alternative to conventional diesel. Green diesel stands out technically, mainly when produced from residual raw materials. Considering green diesel production only from fatty waste, it is estimated to serve approximately 55% of the biodiesel demand in Brazil, today produced mostly from crude soybean oil. In addition, the production of this biofuel may occur in existing plants of oil processing through minor adaptations, which ensures reduced installation costs, production, and logistics, especially when considering the current installed capacity in the country. The biggest deadlock related to large-scale production of green diesel in oil refineries in Brazil is the lack of specific legislation that regulates and defines parameters and conditions for the marketing of biofuel. ©",,"Diesel engines; Laws and legislation; Petroleum prospecting; Soybean oil; Waste incineration; Combustion engines; Economic advantages; Energy productions; Installation costs; Installed capacity; Large scale productions; Technical information; Transesterification process; Biodiesel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098757876

There is a dire need to look for alternative fuels that are less potent to greenhouse gas emissions. Biofuels offer several advantages with less harmful effects on the environment. Biodiesel is synthesized from the organic wastes produced extensively like edible, non-edible, microbial, and waste oils. This study reviews the feasibility of the state-of-the-art feedstocks for sustainable biodiesel synthesis such as availability, and capacity to cover a significant proportion of fossil fuels. Biodiesel synthesized from oil crops, vegetable oils, and animal fats are the potential renewable carbon-neutral substitute to petroleum fuels. This study concludes that waste oils with higher oil content including waste cooking oil, waste palm oil, and algal oil are the most favorable feedstocks. The comparison of biodiesel production and parametric analysis is done critically, which is necessary to come up with the most appropriate feedstock for biodiesel synthesis. Since the critical comparison of feedstocks along with oil extraction and biodiesel production technologies has never been done before, this will help to direct future researchers to use more sustainable feedstocks for biodiesel synthesis. This study concluded that the use of third-generation feedstocks (wastes) is the most appropriate way for sustainable biodiesel production. The use of innovative costless oil extraction technologies including supercritical and microwave-assisted transesterification method is recommended for oil extraction. © 2021 by the authors.","Biodiesel synthesis; Feasibility study; Oil extraction technologies; Potential feedstocks; Renewable energy","biofuel; detection method; essential oil; extraction method; vegetable oil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099835209

However, research on these materials is substantially restricted by the limited trans-scalability of their structural design and tunability of electrical conductivity. To overcome this challenge, a pyrolyzed cellulose nanofiber paper (CNP) semiconductor with a 3D network structure is proposed. Its nano-micro-macro trans-scale structural design is achieved by a combination of iodine-mediated morphology-retaining pyrolysis with spatially controlled drying of a cellulose nanofiber dispersion and paper-crafting techniques, such as microembossing, origami, and kirigami. The electrical conduction of this semiconductor is widely and systematically tuned, via the temperature-controlled progressive pyrolysis of CNP, from insulating (1012 ω cm) to quasimetallic (10-2 ω cm), which considerably exceeds that attained in other previously reported nanomaterials with 3D networks. The pyrolyzed CNP semiconductor provides not only the tailorable functionality for applications ranging from water-vapor-selective sensors to enzymatic biofuel cell electrodes but also the designability of macroscopic device configurations for stretchable and wearable applications.

This lockdown set the precedent for similar measures in other cities across the country, putting a halt to daily activities including industry and traffic. Factories and other industries were shut down and people were confined to their homes. Similar measures were then put in place worldwide in the following weeks and months. As a result, a significant reduction in air pollutants across the world was detected by satellites. This included reduced emissions of particular matter (PM) and nitrogen dioxide. The aim of this work is to investigate the effects of COVID-19 pandemics on NO2 and particular matter (PM) concentrations during lockdown, to answer the question of whether this crisis should reduce the development of biofuels or with regard to the reduction and end of COVID-19 restrictions we need to pay more attention to the effects and importance of biofuels on human health. The lockdown reduced the amount of PM in different countries of the world by 9 to 63% compared to the time of corona lock. Its distribution also decreased by 20–30% in European countries and up to 70% in some Asian countries. But wait, you should not be happy. Because these changes have taken place at a time when the world is facing a crisis and governments are forced to shut down businesses and impose locks. The use of biofuels can also reduce the emission of these air pollutants. Corona conditions once again reminded of the need to use these fuels. The condition of the corona is also temporary, and with the discovery of the corona vaccine and the start of vaccination around the world, these locks will be reduced and air pollutants will return to the time of the previous corona. Therefore, the need to use renewable and sustainable energy such as biofuels becomes apparent. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","biofuels; Covid-19 pandemic; NO2; PM; renewable energy","Air pollution; Biofuels; Locks (fasteners); Nitrogen oxides; % reductions; Air pollutants; Condition; Coronaviruses; Covid-19 pandemic; Daily activity; Human health; Particular matter; Renewable energies; Similar measures; Vaccines",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120091391

GVL can be obtained from biomass-derived furanic compounds through a cascade reaction process, which is extremely challenging due to the need for different active sites in a single pot. Here, we reported a domino conversion process of directly upgrading furfural (FF) to GVL in isopropanol over a commercially available and budget catalyst ZrCl4 that can in-situ release Brønsted acid (HCl) and Lewis acid/base species (ZrO(OH) n ·xH2O). The in-situ formed bifunctional catalyst can significantly enable twice transfer hydrogenation, etherification, the ring-opening, and cyclization reactions, giving a high GVL yield of 56.5% from FF at 180°C for 6 h. In addition, the solid residues collected after reaction could be calcined to obtain t-ZrO2-(C) nanoparticles with a rough surface, in which the insoluble humin attached to the hydrolyzed solid was demonstrated to improve the layered aggregate structure of the resulting t-ZrO2-(C). Interestingly, t-ZrO2-(C) showed good performance in catalytic conversion of FF to furfuryl alcohol (FAOL) with ca. 80% yield.

Transportation-related emissions resulting from petroleum use account for 23% of total energy-related CO2 emissions. Biofuels including biodiesel are renewable substitutes for transportation fuels that have attracted global interest. This paper reviewed existing literature on technological, economic, and life cycle environmental aspects vital for assessment of the viability of production of second-generation biodiesel including the B10 blend advocated for Uganda. The quantity of biodiesel required to fulfil a B10 blend for Uganda’s downstream petroleum sector is one hundred million litres per annum. To meet this demand, 50,000 ha of land is required for cultivation of biodiesel feedstocks against the available 6,900,000 ha. Jatropha, castor, and croton, offer agronomical advantages. Biodiesel produced from these feedstocks through transesterification, should conform to ASTM D6751/EN14214 standards.

This study aimed to produce HMF from fructose dehydration under a biphasic system using various organic acids as catalytic promoters, such as formic acid, acetic acid, lactic acid, succinic acid, and levulinic acid. Among these organic acids, the acetic acid was found to be the best promoter in this system. The experimental results showed a prominent correlation between the HMF formation and the pKa – the higher pKa gave rise to greater HMF yield and lower activity toward side reactions. Response surface methodology was performed to identify the optimum reaction temperature, time, and promoter concentration for fructose dehydration. Among the three variables, the reaction temperature played the most significant role in fructose conversion and HMF yield. The optimum condition to achieve the highest HMF yield at 72.5% from fructose dehydration was found at 195.8 °C under a mild concentration of acetic acid at 0.075 M for 3.2 min.

It poses no threat to food security as it does not compete with agricultural crops for arable land. Scenedesmus acutus was used as feedstock to produce bio-oil in a large liquefaction reactor. The influence of reaction temperature (280–360ºC), reaction atmosphere (N2or CO2) and solvent on bio-oil yield, C-16 fatty acid yield and oil properties were investigated. Oils were characterised using gas chromatography, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and ultimate analysis. Higher bio-oil yields were obtained in a CO2atmosphere (250 g.kg-1dry microalgae) than in a N2atmosphere (210 g.kg-1dry microalgae) whilst higher C16 fatty acid concentrations (600 g.kg-1bio-oil) were recorded in N2atmosphere compared to oil prepared in a CO2atmosphere (500 g.kg-1bio-oil). The oil yield increased to a maximum at 320°C, after which there were no significant changes. Highest bio-oil yields (425 g.kg-1dry microalgae) were obtained in ethanol as solvent. FTIR spectroscopy and ultimate analysis showed that proteins present in the feedstock were degraded by breakage of peptide linkages, and nitrogen present in the oils is peptide fragments from protein degradation. The carbon content of all produced oils was high, but the hydrogen content was low, leading to low hydrogen/carbon ratios. Energy consumption and energy efficiency calculations showed that liquefaction in both reaction atmospheres results in a net energy gain, and a CO2atmosphere is best for high energy efficiency. © 2021.

Green diesel can be produced via deoxygenation from various feedstocks, such as vegetable oils, animal fats, fatty acids, and waste cooking oils. Normally, the deoxygenation reaction in green diesel production occurs in a multiphase system. There are three main pathways in the liquid phase of the reaction: decarboxylation, decarbonylation, and hydrodeoxygenation, from which liquid alkane hydrocarbons can be derived, and these are known as green diesel. This review paper discusses several deoxygenation pathways in a multiphase-reaction process to produce green diesel. Nickel metal is a non-noble metal catalyst which has been confirmed from many studies for use in deoxygenation with good performance. The performance of the nickel catalyst depends on different factors including the type of catalyst support and promoter, reaction temperature, reaction pressure, and reaction time. Finally, recent progress and future trends in green diesel production are discussed. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",,"Carboxylation; Catalysts; Fatty acids; Fossil fuels; Liquids; Nickel; Oils and fats; Precious metals; Animal fat; Deoxygenation reactions; Deoxygenations; Diesel production; Green diesels; Ni-based catalyst; Performance; Second generation; Transportation vehicles; Waste cooking oil; Biodiesel",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108590696

In general, half-cell hydrogenation is paired with water oxidation to generate the low economic value of O2 at the anode. Herein, a new strategy for the rational design of Ru/reduced graphene oxide (Ru/RGO) nanocomposites through a cost-effective and straightforward microwave irradiation technique is reported for the first time. The Ru nanoparticles with an average size of 3.5 nm are well anchored into the RGO frameworks with attractive nanostructures to enhance the furfural's paired electrohydrogenation (ECH) and electrooxidation (ECO) process to achieve high-grade biofuel. Furfural is used as a reactant with the paired electrolyzer to produce furfuryl alcohol and 2-methylfuran at the cathode side. Simultaneously, 2-furic acid and 5-hydroxyfuroic acid along with plenty of H+ and e- are generated at the anode side. Most impressively, the paired electrolyzer induces an extraordinary ECH and ECO of furfural, with the desired production of 2-methylfuran (yield = 91% and faradic efficiency (FE) of 95%) at XFF = 97%, outperforming the ECH half-cell reaction. The mechanisms of the half-cell reaction and paired cell reaction are discussed.

The green material catalysts were utilized as catalysts support of TiO2−ZrO2 binary oxide in the form of nanocomposite materials with superior synergistic properties. The isolation of nanocellulose was achieved using a hydrolysis method with a yield of 63.40%. The TiO2 and ZrO2 nanoparticles have average particle sizes of around 25 and 15 nm, respectively, and the binary oxides of TiO2–ZrO2 pretained an average particle size of 30 nm were used. Furthermore, the nanocellulose combined with the TiO2−ZrO2 binary oxide had formed a cellulose/TiO2−ZrO2 nanocomposite with an average particle size of 30 nm. This indicates that the supporting nanocellulose can stabilize the nanoparticles and avoid aggregation. Moreover, the nanocomposites can be used as a catalyst for the conversion of glucose to 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (5-EMF). The catalytic activity increased with the nanoparticle effect obtained ZrO2, TiO2, TiO2-ZrO2, and cellulose and TiO2-ZrO2 nanocomposite, in 15.50%, 20.20%, 35.20%, and 45.50% yields, respectively. The best yield of 5-EMF was 45.50%, with reaction conditions of 1:1 TiO2–ZrO2 ratio, 4 h reaction time, and 160 °C reaction temperature. The use of nanocellulose biopolymer generated from Sengon sawdust waste in Indonesia provides a promising catalyst support material as an alternative green catalyst. In addition, the glucose carbohydrates can be converted to biofuel feedstocks in the development of a renewable alternative energy.

Microalgae are one of the most important sources of green hydrocarbons because this type of algae has a high percentage of lipids and has rapid growth, consumes the carbon dioxide in large quantities. Besides, the cultivation of these types of algae does not require arable land. This review aims to explain the suitability of microalgae as a biofuel source depending on the fat content, morphology, and other parameters and their effect on the conversion processes of microalgae oil into biofuels by different zeolite catalytic reactions. It also discusses in detail the major chemical processes that convert microalgae oil to chemical products. This review sheds light on one of the most important groups of microalgae (Chlorella vulgaris microalgae). This review includes a historical overview and a comprehensive description of the structure needed to develop this type of algae.

In this current work, Prunus domestica kernel oil was used as a feedstock for synthesizing methyl ester. The FFA value of the kernel oil was examined by employing the isopropyl alcohol technique and found to be 11.63 mg KOH/g. Hence, oil was processed with a two-step transesterification process using acid (H2SO4) and base (NaOH) catalyst reaction to convert into biodiesel. To obtain maximum yield and high-quality biodiesel, an optimization technique was employed. In this technique, the process parameters such as experimental duration, reaction temperature, NaOH concentration, and methanol to oil ratio were optimized based on Taguchi technique. The investigations revealed that 150 min, 60°C, 8:1 ratio, and 1 wt% NaOH were optimal process parameters obtained with a reaction efficiency of 97.86%. The experimental analysis considered that the methanol to oil ratio was happened to be the most substantial entity using ANOVA.

METHODS: For this purpose, the effects of temperature (300-500 °C), carrier gas flow rate (0.2-0.8 L/min), and heating rate (10-20 °C/min) on the final bio-oil production were optimized using response surface methodology established by a central composite design. FINDINGS: The highest bio-oil yield from U. fasciata (34.29%) was obtained at the temperature of 500 °C, nitrogen flow rate of 0.2 L/min, and heating rate of 10 °C/min. As for A. filiculoides feedstock, the highest bio-oil yield (30.83%) was achieved at the temperature of 461 °C, nitrogen flow rate of 0.5 L/min, and heating rate of 20 °C/min. Both bio-oil samples contained saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons. However, the average hydrocarbon chain length was relatively shorter in U. fasciata bio-oil (C4-C16) than in bio-oil from A. filiculoides (C6-C24). Although both bio-oils had almost identical heating values, the U. fasciata bio-oil showed more appropriate properties, i.e. lower viscosity and density. Furthermore, the energy recovery from U. fasciata pyrolysis was calculated as 56.6% which was almost 1.5 times higher than the energy recovery from A. filiculoides pyrolysis. CONCLUSION: The results indicated that U. fasciata bio-oil, with its superior characteristics, could be proposed as a promising candidate for application in diesel-based automotive industries. ©2021 GJESM.

Adsorption kinetics and thermodynamic parameters of this separation method were studied at different conditions of pH and temperature. Results showed that the maximum adsorption capacities of these bioalcohols were obtained at pH 6 and 20°C. An exothermic separation was identified, which can be mainly associated to hydrophobic interactions between bone char surface and bioalcohols. Binary adsorption studies were also performed using mixtures of these bioalcohols. An antagonistic adsorption was observed for all bioalcohols where the ethanol and propanol separation was significantly affected by butanol. A model based on an artificial neural network was proposed to correlate both single and binary adsorption isotherms of these bioalcohols with bone char.

Biodiesel is considered to be the most potent alternative to fossil energy, mainly due to its green, renewable, and biodegradable advantages. The stable, efficient and reusable catalysts are undoubtedly the most critical in the preparation of biodiesel. Among them, nanoporous carbon-based acidic materials are very important biodiesel catalysts. Objective: The latest advances of acidic nanoporous carbon catalysts in biodiesel production was reviewed. Methods: Biodiesel is mainly synthesized by esterification and transesterification. Due to the important role of nanoporous carbon-based acidic materials in the catalytic preparation of biodiesel, we focused on the synthesis, physical and chemical properties, catalytic performance and reusability. Results: Acidic catalytic materials have a good catalytic performance for high acid value feedstocks. However, the preparation of biodiesel with acid catalyst requires relatively strict reaction conditions. The application of nanoporous acidic carbon-based materials, due to the support of carbon-based framework, makes the catalyst exhibit good stability and unique pore structure, accelerates the reaction mass transfer speed, which in turn accelerated the reaction. Conclusion: Nanoporous carbon-based acidic catalysts have the advantages such as, suitable pore structure, high active sites, and high stability. In order to make these catalytic processes more efficient, environmentally friendly and low cost, developing new catalytic materials with high specific surface area, suitable pore size, high acid density, and excellent performance would be an important research direction for the future biodiesel catalysts. © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers.","Acidic carbon catalysts; Biodiesel; Esterification; High acid value oil; Nanoporous materials; Transesterification","Biodiesel; Carbon; Catalyst activity; Computer software reusability; Mass transfer; Pore size; Pore structure; Reusability; Synthetic fuels; Biodiesel production; Carbon based materials; Catalytic materials; Catalytic performance; High specific surface area; Physical and chemical properties; Reaction conditions; Reusable catalysts; Nanocatalysts; activated carbon; biodiesel; carbon; carbon nanotube; nanoporous material; organic compound; acidity; Article; biofuel production; biomass; carbonization; catalyst; esterification; mass; priority journal; synthesis; transesterification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103453156

Catalytic conversion of biomass to renewable energies is among the promising approaches to materialize the above. This requires development of robust catalysts to suppress deactivation due to carbon deposition and agglomeration. In this work, surface properties and chemistry such as exsolution of B-site metal catalyst nanoparticles, particle size and distribution, as well as catalyst-support interactions were tailored through the use of alkaline dopants to enhance catalytic behaviour in valorisation of glycerol. The incorporation of alkaline metals into the lattice of an Asite deficient perovskite modified the surface basic properties and morphology with a consequent robust catalyst-support interaction. This resulted in promising catalytic behaviour of the materials where hydrogen selectivity of over 30% and CO selectivity of over 60% were observed. The catalyst ability to reduce fouling of the catalyst surface as a result of carbon deposition during operation was also profound due to the robust catalyst-support interaction occurring at the exsolved nanoparticles due to their socketing and the synergy between the dopant metals in the alloy in perovskite catalyst systems. In particular, one of the designed systems, La0.4Sr0.2Ca0.3Ni0.1Ti0.9O3±δ, displayed almost 100% resistance to carbon deposition. Therefore, lattice rearrangement using exsolution and choice of suitable dopant could be tailored to improve catalytic performance. © 2021 BRTeam.

Biofuels have a lot of interesting applications in various industries. The main objective of the current study was to assess the biomass and lipid production, gene expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (accD) and ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase large-chain (rbcL), and the lipid content produced by myo-inositol treatment in the microalga Chlorella vulgaris. Three different myo-inositol concentrations (i.e., 50, 100, and 200 mg/L) were added to the algal growth media, and the algal cells were sampled on the day of entering the stationary phase of the growth cycle. Biomass production was increased by increasing the supplement. However, the 200 mg/L concentration of myo-inositol was critical for lipid production. To evaluate the effect of the vitamin on the expression of the accD and rbcL genes, real-time PCR was used. The rbcL gene expression increased in relation to biomass production, i.e., 224.08 times higher than the control. On the other hand, the accD expression at 200 mg/L myo-inositol concentration, as physiological stress, increased, i.e., 95.2 times higher than the control. Therefore, this growth complement can induce biomass and lipid production. Findings of the present study provide valuable insight into determining the biochemical modulation strategies of biomass and lipid production. In this study, two separate controlling systems and two independent promoters were proposed to regulate the transcription of rbcL and accD genes induced by various concentrations of myo-inositol. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","accD; Biodiesel; Phototrophic; rbcL","Alcohols; Algae; Biodiesel; Biomass; Ecology; Microorganisms; Polymerase chain reaction; Sugars; Transcription; Acetyl-CoA carboxylase; Biochemical modulations; Biomass productions; Chlorella vulgaris; Controlling system; Lipid productions; Phototrophic microorganisms; Physiological stress; Polyols",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099950142

Response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural network (ANN) tools were used for the modelling and optimization of the process variables. The reaction process parameters considered were methanol/SBSO molar ratio, catalyst loading levels, reaction time and temperature. Central composite design (CCD) was espoused to generate 30 experimental conditions which were deployed in investigating the individual and synergetic effect of the process input variables on Sclerocarya birrea oil methyl ester (SBOME) yield. Appropriate statistical indices were adopted to investigate the predictive aptitude of the two models. Analysis shows that ANN model obtained for the transesterification process has a higher coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9846 and lower absolute average deviation (AAD) of 0.07% compared to RSM model with R2 of 0.9482 and AAD of 0.12%. The process modelling outcome also confirmed ANN performance to be more precise than RSM. At methanol/ SBSO ratio of 6:1, catalyst loading level of 2 wt%, process reaction time of 50 min and temperature of 55°C, the experimental maximum SBOME yield was observed to be 96.45 wt % following the ANN predicted yield of 96.45 wt % and RSM predicted yield of 96.65 wt % respectively. The analysed fuel properties of SBOME was found satisfactory within the biodiesel stipulated standard limit(s). The study establishes that SBSO is a good source for biodiesel production and its biodiesel methyl ester is a potential substitute for petroleum diesel and a bioenergy fuel. © 2021 by Japan Oil Chemists’ Society.","Biodiesel production; Heterogenous catalyst; Modelling; Optimization; Sclerocarya birrea seed oil","Catalysts; Esters; Methanol; Molar ratio; Neural networks; Oils and fats; Transesterification; Absolute average deviation; Biodiesel production; Central composite designs; Coefficient of determination; Experimental conditions; Process input variables; Response surface methodology; Transesterification process; Biodiesel; alkali; biofuel; methanol; vegetable oil; Anacardiaceae; catalysis; chemistry; esterification; isolation and purification; Musa; plant seed; temperature; Alkalies; Anacardiaceae; Biofuels; Catalysis; Esterification; Methanol; Musa; Plant Oils; Seeds; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099658518

Currently, biodiesel potential of microalgae has been confined at lab scale; however, economic feasibility is a limiting factor for commercialization. Thus, development of large-scale production system is an essential element to assess economic feasibility as well as policy support needed to implement large-scale production. To answer this, Dunaliella tertiolecta was selected for biodiesel feedstock production among other isolates, having 1.244 g/L dry biomass yield and 37%w/w lipid content. Operational cost of biodiesel production was 3.19 USD/L for lab scale which can be reduced to 0.77 USD/L at large-scale production by integrated and efficient resource utilization, namely, natural seawater (NSW), as growth media and unproductive coastland for production site. Capital investment of USD 82019.89 was calculated for biodiesel production facility with 16.7 KL annual production for one-hectare unproductive land. Economic evaluation of 10 years of production resulted into net present value (NPV) of USD 750.91 and 5.18% internal rate of return (IRR). Capital recovery can be achieved in 7.76 years as per normal payback analysis. Additionally, NPV can be increased to USD 30355 by upscaling production to five times with 50% more biomass productivity that would result into 14.23% IRR. Efficient resource integration, multiple products and co-products with market linkages, and appropriate policy facilitation are key factors for commercial viability of microalgae biodiesel production. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Biodiesel; Cost analysis; Dunaliella tertiolecta; Economic analysis; Internal rate of return (IRR); Microalgae; Policy","Algae; Biodiesel; Earnings; Feedstocks; Investments; Large scale systems; Microorganisms; Biomass productivity; Dunaliella tertiolecta; Economic evaluations; Economic feasibilities; Internal rate of return; Large scale cultivations; Large scale productions; Resource utilizations; Economic analysis",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099071177

Although magnesium oxide catalyst does not have as strong of basic sites as calcium oxide catalyst, it is stable under ambient conditions. Furthermore, magnesium oxide catalyst activity is not sensitive to the water content of the reactants, which makes magnesium oxide catalyst possible for commercial purposes. In addition, the use of the non-magnetic catalyst could be facilely recovered by magnetic and reusable several times without a notable decrease in catalytic activity. In the present study, MgO /Fe2O3-SiO2 core-shell magnetic nanocatalyst was synthesized by precipitation method for biodiesel production. This nanocatalyst was characterized by different techniques such as Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) to recognize functional groups, measurement magnetic characteristics by vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), identification of the phase and crystalline structure of nanocatalysts using X-radiation (XRD) and a survey of morphology and surface properties by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Then, the synthesized catalyst was utilized to synthesis biodiesel from the transesterification reaction of camelina seed oil with methyl alcohol. A high biodiesel efficiency (99 %) was obtained under optimized conditions using the central composite design (CCD) based on the response surface methodology (RSM). The optimization was carried out in two separate parts; the initial part focuses on the optimization of the variables affecting the catalytic performance and the second part includes optimizing the variables affecting the reaction conditions of biodiesel production. The biodiesel was examined by GC- Mass spectra and physicochemical characteristics such as viscosity and refractive index. The optimum performance was achieved over MgO /Fe2O3-SiO2 core-shell magnetic nanocatalyst at calcination time 2.29 h, calcination temperature 650 ͦ C, 55.25 % w/w MgO to Fe2O3-SiO2 core-shell magnetic nanocatalyst, methanol to oil molar ratio 12/1, the catalyst to oil weight ratio 4.9 % w/w, reaction temperature 70 ͦ C and reaction time 4.1 h. Moreover, MgO /Fe2O3-SiO2 core-shell magnetic nanocatalyst could be removed facilely from the reaction system by a magnet and catalytic performance maintained for the four reused cycles.

The use of heterogeneous catalysts for the transesterification of vegetable oils has gained prominence due to their eco-friendly and reusable nature. Pure hydroxyapatite (HAp) and hydroxyapatite/platinum (HAp/Pt) nanostructured particles were prepared through a facile chemical method without templates and surfactants and their catalytic activity investigated for transesterification of natural vegetable oil to bioenergy (biodiesel). The textural and structural features of pure HAp and HAp/Pt were evaluated using FTIR and Raman spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The elements present in the prepared nanostructures were confirmed through energy dispersive spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques. The XPS analysis confirmed the metallic nature of the platinum in HAp/Pt. The specific surface area and porous nature of the prepared nanostructured catalysts were studied using the N2 physisorption Brunauer-Emmett-Teller-Barrett-Joyner-Halenda method.

Waste fishing net oil (WFNO) was obtained by pyrolysis process. The properties of WFNO revealed that oil produced from the waste fishing net can be used in a diesel engine without any engine modifications. The nano additive was characterized by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM) and also by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). At a constant speed of 1500 rpm, engine performance, emission and combustion characteristics were analysed and compared with conventional diesel fuel. Engine test showed that fuel produced from the waste fishing net was able to work efficiently in a diesel engine without any engine alterations. Experimental results revealed that there was a significant improvement in combustion characteristic with the incorporation of MWCNT with WFNO. At 100% load, brake thermal efficiency was increased by 3.83% and brake specific fuel consumption was decreased by 3.87% with the addition of MWCNT to WFNO. Further, the results showed a significant reduction in engine exhaust emissions like CO, UHC, NO and smoke by 25%, 9.09% 5.25% and 14.81% respectively and a slight increase in CO2 emission by 17.39%. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","engine performance; fuel properties; multi-walled carbon nanotubes; pyrolysis; Waste fishing net oil","Additives; Brakes; Diesel engines; Enamels; Field emission microscopes; Fisheries; Fuels; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Nanotubes; Petroleum additives; Pyrolysis; Scanning electron microscopy; Smoke; Waste incineration; Brake specific fuel consumption; Brake thermal efficiency; Combustion characteristics; Engine performance; Exhaust emission; Field emission scanning electron microscopy; Fuel properties; Pyrolysis process; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN); carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; diesel fuel; hydrocarbon; multi walled nanotube; nitric oxide; biofuel; carbon nanotube; gasoline; additive; carbon nanotube; combustion; diesel engine; exhaust emission; experimental study; fishing gear; fuel consumption; performance assessment; pyrolysis; combustion; diesel engine; energy consumption; energy resource; exhaust gas; feasibility study; field emission scanning electron microscopy; pyrolysis; transmission electron microscopy; waste fishing net oil; Biofuels; Gasoline; Nanotubes, Carbon; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066100129

At present, it is reported that such catalysts generally have some shortcomings including strict reaction conditions, complicated catalyst preparation and low reaction efficiency. Herein, Ru/Nb2O5 catalyst with the macropore structure prepared by an incipient wetness impregnation method could effectively promote the aromatic rings hydrogenation of various lignin-derived compounds under extremely mild condition (30 °C). The resulting aliphatic compounds with the high yield provided abundant raw materials for the production of fine chemicals and biofuels. In this case, further experiments revealed that it was H2 rather than solvents provided the only hydrogen source. A relatively low bond energy of Ru0 in Ru/Nb2O5 promoted the formation of active hydrogen from H2. Due to the acid loss of Ru/Nb2O5 catalyst, the hydrodeoxygenation reaction did not occur. Moreover, the catalyst was investigated under different influence parameters in order to obtain the optimal reaction conditions (30 °C, 3 MPa H2).

The oil recovery yields from dry and wet microalgae using hexane were 44.4 and 11.8%, respectively, whereas using a hexane-methanol mixture were increased to 79.3 and 74.8%, respectively. For the heterogeneous transesterification of microalgal oil extracted by the hexane-methanol mixture from wet microalgae, the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) contents were 2.3, 48.3, and 4.7% of product recovered after reaction for ZSM-5, Na/ZSM-5, and SO42−/ZSM-5, respectively; by the potassium hydroxide-assisted process, the corresponding FAME contents were increased to 21.9, 86.2, and 86.0%, respectively, due to improvement of the oil properties by the decrease of the chlorophyll content. Through the addition of potassium hydroxide, chlorophyll was effectively removed from oil, and eventually, the biodiesel conversion was sharply increased with heterogeneous Na/ZSM-5 and SO42−/ZSM-5 catalysts. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Chlorophyll removal; Heterogeneous catalyst; Microalgal biodiesel; Nannochloropsis oceanica; Wet oil extraction","Algae; Biodiesel; Catalysts; Chlorophyll; Fatty acids; Hexane; Methanol; Microorganisms; Mixtures; Potassium hydroxide; Transesterification; Chlorophyll contents; Fatty acid methyl ester; Heterogeneous catalyst; Heterogeneous transesterification; Methanol mixtures; Microalgal oil; Oil recoveries; Simultaneous removal; Solvent extraction; biofuel; chemical reaction; detection method; extraction method; green alga; inorganic compound; microalga; solvent; Nannochloropsis oceanica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092535238

In this study, novel nanocatalyst (GO@ZrO2–SrO) was synthesized via co-precipitation method by the combination of both potential graphene oxide and bimetal zirconium/strontium oxide nanoparticles. The proposed nanocomposite showed a promising ability as a heterogeneous catalyst for the transesterification of WCO to produce FAMEs as biodiesel. The FTIR, SEM/EDX and XRD were used for the characterization of nanocatalyst to evaluate the surface functional groups, nanostructure/elements and crystallinity, respectively. The effective parameters on the transesterification FAMEs yield including oil to alcohol ratio, reaction time, and reaction temperature were studied. Based on the results, the maximum FAMEs yield of 91% was obtained in the conditions of the material ratio of 1:0.5 (w/w) of GO:ZrO2–SrO, oil to methanol ratio (1:4), the reaction time of 90 min and the temperature of 120 °C.

The fly ash used in this research had a high content of both CaO and SO3, two compounds that have been previously proposed as catalysts in FAME production. The study was carried out on the basis of a response surface methodology (RSM). The model generated by RSM predicted as optimal conditions to obtain a 100% FAME yield at a methanol-to-oil molar ratio of 3.1:1, 11.2 (wt.% based on oil weight) fly ash and a temperature of 59 °C with agitation at 245 rpm and 6 h of reaction time. Additional experiments comparing anhydrous with aqueous medium showed that fly ash presented a high catalytic capacity to transform free fatty acids (FFA) into FAME through consecutive hydrolysis and esterification processes (hydroesterification) compared with that associated with the transesterification mechanism. According to the results, the fly ash used in this study would act as a multipurpose or “versatile” catalyst due to its chemical composition with constituents that act as acidic and basic catalysts, therefore, catalyzing the transesterification and hydroesterification reactions simultaneously and increasing the conversion yields of FAME. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiesel; Fatty acid methyl ester; Fly ash; Response surface methodology; Transesterification; Waste frying oils","Biodiesel; Calcium oxide; Catalysts; Esters; Fly ash; Molar ratio; Transesterification; Acid-base catalysts; Additional experiments; Biodiesel production; Chemical compositions; Fatty acid methyl ester; Heterogeneous catalyst; Response surface methodology; Transesterification mechanisms; Fatty acids; biofuel; biological production; catalyst; chemical composition; ester; fly ash; response surface methodology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092342592

Although biodiesel has many benefits to offer, manufacturing biodiesel on an industrial scale is uneconomical as a high cost of feedstock is required. A novel sulfonated and magnetic catalyst synthesised from a palm kernel shell (PMB-SO3H) was first introduced in this study for methyl ester or biodiesel production to reduce capital costs. The wasted palm kernel shell (PKS) biochar impregnated with ferrite Fe3O4 was synthesised with concentrated sulphuric acid through the sulfonation process. The SEM, EDX, FTIR, VSM and TGA characterization of the catalysts were presented. Then, the optimisation of biodiesel synthesis was catalysed by PMB-SO3H via the Response Surface Methodology (RSM). It was found that the maximum biodiesel yield of 90.2% was achieved under these optimum operating conditions: 65 °C, 102 min, methanol to oil ratio of 13:1 and the catalyst loading of 3.66 wt%. Overall, PMB-SO3H demonstrated acceptable catalysing capability on its first cycle, which subsequently showed a reduction of the reusability performance after 4 cycles. An important practical implication is that PMB-SO3H can be established as a promising heterogeneous catalyst by incorporating an iron layer which can substantially improve the catalyst separation performance in biodiesel production. © 2020","Biochar; Biodiesel; Magnetic catalyst; Response Surface Methodology; Waste","Catalysts; Costs; Fossil fuels; Iron oxides; Magnetite; Reusability; Sulfonation; Synthetic fuels; Biodiesel production; Biodiesel synthesis; Catalyst separation; Environment friendly; Heterogeneous catalyst; Optimum operating conditions; Response surface methodology; Sulfonation process; Biodiesel; biodiesel; carbon; ester derivative; ferrite; methanol; methyl ester; palm kernel shell magnetic biochar; sulfuric acid; unclassified drug; biochar; biofuel; charcoal; vegetable oil; alternative energy; biochar; biofuel; catalyst; magnetic property; optimization; plant residue; reaction kinetics; waste management; agricultural waste; Arecaceae; Article; biofuel production; catalysis; catalyst; concentration (parameter); cost control; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; magnetism; priority journal; reaction optimization; recycling; response surface method; scanning electron microscopy; seed kernel; sulfonation; surface property; synthesis; thermogravimetry; vibrating sample magnetometry; esterification; Biofuels; Charcoal; Esterification; Magnetic Phenomena; Plant Oils",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091772790

Herein, the sulfonated porous carbon catalysts derived from the rinds of corn stalk biomass wastes were prepared by using sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid as the sulfonating agent and activator, respectively. The preparation parameters were optimized based on the catalytic activity for LA esterification with ethanol and the acid density of the corresponding catalysts. Also, various reaction factors were optimized to improve the catalytic efficiency over the optimal sulfonated corn stalk-derived carbon (s-CSC). Under the conditions of reaction temperature 80 °C, catalyst dosage 5 wt%, ethanol-to-LA molar ratio 5.0:1 and reaction time 8 h, the LA conversion reached 94% and 93% catalyzed by s-CSC and the optimal porous catalyst (s-p-CSC), respectively. Noticeably, benefitting from the hierarchical porous structure with large surface area, s-p-CSC exhibited much better recyclability than s-CSC.

A renewable heterogeneous catalyst is synthesized using calcium oxide obtained from calcination of waste egg shells and modified using cobalt nitrate hexahydrate by co-precipitation method. The synthesized catalyst is characterized by XRD, SEM, EDX, FTIR, TEM techniques. Lipid extracted from the biomass is converted to biodiesel using the synthesized catalyst. The formation of biodiesel is confirmed using 1H NMR, 13C NMR and GC-MS techniques. The result demonstrated that the CaO–Co catalyst has very high catalytic activity for biodiesel production.

However, the hydrolysis performance of immobilized cellulase was not satisfactory for practical application due to the reduced catalytic efficiency and lack of β-glucosidase (BG) component in cellulase. Here, a facile method was developed to sequentially co-immobilize BG and cellulase by polymeric microparticles with hierarchical structure. In this strategy, BG was firstly entrapped into the cross-linked poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) microparticles via inverse emulsion polymerization initiated by isopropyl thioxanthone (ITX) under the irradiation of visible light, leaving the formed ITX semi-pinacol (ITXSP) dormant groups on surface of BG-loaded microparticles, which could be further activated by visible light irradiation and initiated a graft polymerization to introduce poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) brush on the PEG core. After that, cellulase was covalently bonded on the PAA chains via carbodiimide reaction. The synergic effect of BG and cellulase was verified in the dual enzyme immobilization system, which led to a better stability at a wide range of temperature and pH than free enzymes. The dual enzymes system exhibited excellent reusability, which could retain 75% and 57% of the initial activity after 10 cycles of hydrolysis of carboxyl methyl cellulose and 5 cycles of hydrolysis of filter paper, respectively, indicative of the potential in biofuel areas in a cost-effective manner. © 2020, Chinese Chemical Society Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Cellulase; Enzyme immobilization; Grafting polymerization; Visible light","Bioconversion; Biofuels; Cellulose; Cost effectiveness; Emulsification; Emulsion polymerization; Energy policy; Enzyme immobilization; Hydrolysis; Irradiation; Light; Polyethylene glycols; Polyethylene oxides; Reusability; Biomass conversion; Carboxyl methyl cellulose; Catalytic efficiencies; Graft polymerization; Hierarchical structures; Inverse emulsion polymerization; Polymeric microparticles; Visible-light irradiation; Cellulose derivatives",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085872317

To achieve the above attributes, lots of new strategies are being used by the researchers for the development of advanced materials. Nowadays, nanomaterials and nanocomposites are the promising material that has been utilized as effective electrode material in solar cells, supercapacitors and biofuel cells application. Herein, we account for a novel electrocatalyst as electrode material that comprised ZnO nanoparticles decorated on the surface of polyindole (PIn)-multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT), for the immobilization of glucose oxidase (GOx) enzyme and mediator (Ferritin). The PIn-MWCNT scaffold is prepared via in situ chemical oxidative polymerization of indole on the surface of MWCNT and assessed by myriad techniques. The micrograph of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) designated the interconnected morphology of MWCNTs in the polymer matrix. X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), confirm the crystallinity and different functional groups available in the synthesized material, respectively. The electrochemical assessment demonstrates that the ZnO/PIn-MWCNT/Frt/GOx nanobiocatalyst exhibits much higher electrocatalytic activity towards the oxidation of glucose with a maximum current density of 4.9 mA cm−2 by consuming 50 mM glucose concentration in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) as the testing solution by applying 100 mVs−1 scan rates. The outcomes reflect that the as-prepared ZnO/PIn-MWCNTs/Frt/GOx biocomposite is a promising bioanode for the development of EBFCs. © 2020, The Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082083834

The catalyst supporter was synthesized using coprecipitation methods to form highly crystalline meso-macrostructured ZnO particles. The catalyst support was wet-impregnated with different loadings (wt %) of NiO to prepare the NiO–ZnO catalyst. X-ray diffraction patterns verified the persistence of good crystallinity and phase purity of the support, with fine NiO crystallites of size 14–22 nm. Synthesized NiO–ZnO catalysts demonstrated Type IV isotherm with H3 hysteresis loop with mesoporous-macroporous properties. The Brønsted and Lewis acidic sites of NiO–ZnO offer a synergy effect between the active site and catalyst supporter. Both N2 adsorption isotherm and electron microscopy analysis revealed the increase of the crystallite size of the catalyst by increase the NiO loadings. The catalytic activity of the NiO–ZnO catalyst was tested in a semi-batch reactor at 350 °C for 2 h in N2 atmospheric. The oxygenated compounds of palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) have been successfully removed to form linear hydrocarbons as green diesel compounds. The synergistic effect between NiO and ZnO significantly enhanced the catalytic activity for substrate DO. The hydrocarbons product yield reached 83.4%, with a diesel range (C11–C17) selectivity of 86.0%. The green diesel, which contains diesel-range hydrocarbons, is suitable as an alternative fuel product for vehicle engine usage. It is possible to be upscaled and compatible with the existed petrochemical refinery facilities.

Microalgae-derived biofuel can be a solution to replace traditional fuel; however, biofuel contains much nitrogen-containing compounds (NCCs) such as carbazole (CBZ) and benzonitrile (PhCN). In this work, effective denitrogenation of biofuel was investigated by using MOFs, especially having multi-functional groups and high porosity. MIL-101-NH2 was modified with oxalyl chloride (OC) to have a MOF called M101-OC. The M101-OC showed remarkable performance in adsorptive denitrogenation from biofuel. Or, M101-OC had 3.8- and 19.6-times adsorption capacity for CBZ and PhCN that of activated carbon, respectively; and showed the highest adsorption capacity, compared with any known adsorbent. The noticeable performances of M101-OC could be explained with hydrogen bonding due to ample hydrogen donor and hydrogen acceptor sites on the M101-OC. Finally, the investigated MOF was also easily recycled via simple ethanol washing. Therefore, M101-OC might be a promising adsorbent for the purification of microalgae-derived biofuel having much NCCs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Adsorption; Algae-derived fuel; Denitrogenation; Functionalization; MOF","Activated carbon; Adsorption; Algae; Aromatic compounds; Chlorine compounds; Fossil fuel deposits; Fossil fuels; Hydrogen; Hydrogen bonds; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Microorganisms; Nitrogen removal; Organometallics; Adsorption capacities; Adsorptive denitrogenation; Alternative energy resources; Denitrogenation; Functionalized; Hydrogen acceptor; Oxalyl chloride; Traditional fuels; Biofuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087823277

The process takes place in one reactor combining two catalytic functions, Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 (CZA) for the synthesis of methanol and an acid catalyst (typically γ-Al2O3) for methanol dehydration to DME. However, the catalytic performance of those catalysts is negatively affected by the high CO2/CO ratio in the bio-syngas, resulting in low methanol and DME production rates. In this work, we show that promoters such as zirconium and gallium oxides increase the CO fraction in the syngas. However, the production of H2O is also increased, leading to the deactivation of both CZA and γ-Al2O3. The addition of a water sorbent (zeolite 3A) in the reaction medium alleviates the detrimental effect of H2O in the direct synthesis of DME from CO2-rich syngas. Thus, DME production over the CZA/γ-Al2O3 catalytic bed increases from ca. 8.7% to 70% when a zeolite 3A is placed in the reaction medium. In fact, carbon conversions higher than conventional equilibrium conversions are achieved. This work demonstrates that the sorption enhanced synthesis of DME is a suitable strategy to increase DME production from biomass-derived syngas. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Catalysis; Catalysts; Ethers; Fuels; Gallium compounds; Methanol; Sorption; Synthesis gas; Zeolites; Zirconium compounds; Carbon conversions; Catalytic functions; Catalytic performance; Dimethyl ether synthesis; Direct synthesis; Equilibrium conversion; Methanol dehydration; Production rates; Synthesis gas manufacture; biogas; biomass power; catalyst; chemical alteration; dehydration; ether; gallium; methanol; sorption; zeolite",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096004689

Dispersing RGO on three-dimensional (3D) carbon paper electrodes is one strategy towards overcoming this challenge, with partial relief aggregation. In this report, we describe the grafting of negatively charged 4-aminobenzoic acid (4-ABA) onto a graphene functionalized carbon paper electrode surface. 4-ABA functionalization induces separation of the RGO layers, at the same time leading to favorable orientation of the blue multi-copper enzyme Myrothecium verrucaria bilirubin oxidase (MvBOD) for direct electron transfer (DET) in the dioxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at neutral pH. Simultaneous electroreduction of graphene oxide to RGO and covalent attachment of 4-ABA are achieved by applying alternating cathodic and anodic electrochemical potential pulses, leading to a high catalytic current density (Δjcat:193 ± 4 μA cm−2) under static conditions. Electrochemically grafted 4-ABA not only leads to a favorable orientation of BOD as validated by fitting a kinetic model to the electrocatalytic data, but also acts to alleviate RGO aggregation as disclosed by scanning electron microscopy, most likely due to the electrostatic repulsion between 4-ABA-grafted graphene layers. With a half-lifetime of 55 h, the bioelectrode also shows the highest operational stability for DET-type MvBOD-based bioelectrodes reported to date. The bioelectrode was finally shown to work well as a biocathode of a membrane-less glucose/O2 enzymatic biofuel cell with a maximum power density of 22 μW cm−2 and an open circuit voltage of 0.51 V. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","4-Aminobenzoic acid monolayer; Bilirubin oxidase; Carbon paper; Direct electron transfer; Gas diffusion bioelectrode; Reduced graphene oxide","Anodic oxidation; Electrodes; Electrolytic reduction; Enzymatic fuel cells; Grafting (chemical); Open circuit voltage; Paper; Scanning electron microscopy; Covalent attachment; Direct electron transfer; Electrochemical potential; Electrostatic repulsion; Maximum power density; Operational stability; Reduced graphene oxides (RGO); Threedimensional (3-d); Graphene; 4 aminobenzoic acid; bilirubin oxidase; graphene; graphene oxide; oxidoreductase; unclassified drug; bilirubin oxidase; graphite; immobilized enzyme; oxidoreductase; aggregation; anodic electrochemical potential pulse; Article; autolab PGSTAT12 system; catalysis; cathodic electrochemical potential pulse; chemical phenomena; chemical procedures; chemical reaction; controlled study; current density; density; dioxygen reduction reaction; direct electron transfer; electric potential; electrical parameters; electrical potential parameters; electrocatalysis; electron transport; electroreduction; electrostatic repulsion; functionalization; Myrothecium; Myrothecium verrucaria; nonhuman; power density; scanning electron microscopy; electrode; genetic procedures; Hypocreales; Biosensing Techniques; Electrodes; Enzymes, Immobilized; Graphite; Hypocreales; Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-CH Group Donors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089516480

The fuel properties and storage stability characteristics of emulsion fuels were explored. The combustion characteristic analysis showed that the ignition temperatures of emulsion fuels (139.6–151.3 °C) were lower than that of bio-oil (176.9 °C). Besides, emulsion fuels had higher comprehensive combustion indexes (7.24–14.08 × 10−6 × min−2 × C−3) than bio-oil (1.51 × 10−6 × min−2 × C−3), indicating that emulsion fuels had better combustion performance. The kinetic analysis showed that emulsification could effectively reduce the activation energy, resulting in less energy input for combustion. Based on chemical composition evolution during the storage process, a possible stability mechanism was proposed.

The threat could be inverted onto an opportunity if an efficient method exists to turn microalgae into valuable fuel products. An experiment was conducted to optimize an efficient pyrolysis conditions to produce bio-fuel from such increasingly prevailing microalgae. Five pyrolysis tests were set, including two different temperatures of 400 and 500 °C, two flow rates of 0.3 and 0.6 ml/min, and three heating rates of 10, 15 and 20 °C /min. On the other hand, in order to further evaluate the quality of pyrolysis oil, three hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) tests were run, including three temperatures of 200, 250 and 300 °C as well as three residence times of 1, 1.5 and 2 h.

Algal cells contain high quantity of biofuel precursors such as starch and lipid granules. In the past decades, microalgal biomass has emerged as a potential feedstock for bioenergy generation. In the current scenario, it is being extensively explored to produce liquid (bioethanol, biodiesel) and gaseous (biomethane, biohydrogen) fuels. Algal technology has four crucial aspects including strain selection and its cultivation, harvesting techniques, conversion routes, and pretreatment of biomass. The quality and quantity of biomass, available media source, cultivation system as well as environmental conditions collectively help in the selection of the specific algal strain. Despite several in-depth attempts, there are various hurdles and limitations to make algal biofuel technically and economically viable. To meet the operational and economic feasibility, a collective approach is desirable. The present state-of-the-art review deals with all four crucial aspects of algal technology. The manuscript especially covers the significant methods of harvesting, energy conversion, and pretreatment. Moreover, it also revels the advantage of biological agent mediated harvesting, energy conversion and the pretreatment of algal biomass for sustainable biofuel recovery. The prime objective of this review is to give an insight into the aspects of algal technology to promote collective research in the area of algal biofuel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.","Algal biofuel; Biomass solubilization; Conversion technique; Hydrothermal liquefaction; Microbial assisted harvesting; Sustainable biofuel recovery","Algae; Bioethanol; Cultivation; Energy conversion; Bioenergy productions; Economic feasibilities; Economically viable; Environmental conditions; Eukaryotic organisms; Microalgal biomass; Potential feedstock; State-of-the art reviews; Biomass",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093364194

This catalytic reaction was carried out in a dielectric-barrier discharge plasma reactor over 5 wt% K2O/CaO–ZnO catalyst under conditions of atmospheric pressure and the reactor temperature of 65 °C. During the hybrid catalytic-plasma reaction system, the voltage, the catalyst diameter, and the Weight Hourly Space Velocity (WHSV) were kept constant at 5 kV, 5 mm, and 1.186/min, respectively. It was found that transesterification reaction with the hybrid roles of catalytic and plasma achieved 77.2% biodiesel yield. Kinetic studies of this transesterification reaction over a continuous flow hybrid catalytic-plasma reactor suggested following Eley-Rideal mechanism model, where the methanol adsorbed on the catalyst surface reacted with triglycerides in bulk phase to produce an adsorbed methyl ester and glycerol in bulk phase. The possible reaction rate law model found is: -rTG = rME = rs = (0.0078∗(0.0061∗CTG∗CM3–3.0302 × 10−6∗CME3∗CG))/(0.1827∗CM+ 0.0145∗CME+1)3 gmol/gcat.min.

Biomass derived from waste agricultural and forestry materials or non-food crops offers the most easily implemented and economical solutions for transportation fuels, and the only nonpetroleum route to organic molecules for the manufacture of bulk, fine, and speciality chemicals necessary to secure the future needs of society. The successful implementation of biorefineries can address concerns over dwindling oil reserves, carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel sources and associated climate change, and will be underpinned by catalytic processes to facilitate the co-production of platform chemicals and biofuels. Catalysis is a central theme in sustainable chemistry, lowering energy and resource requirements while minimising waste production. In contrast to fossil-derived crude oil, which has low oxygen content, the high oxygen and water content of biomass feedstocks presents challenges for their utilisation and requires innovations in catalyst and process design for the selective conversion of these hydrophilic, bulky feedstocks into fuels or high-value chemicals.

After the extraction of specific value-added products, algal residues can be further converted into biogas, biofuel, and biochar through various thermochemical treatments such as conventional pyrolysis, microwave pyrolysis, hydrothermal conversion, and torrefaction. The compositions and physicochemical characteristics of algal biochar that determine the subsequent applications are comprehensively discussed. Algal biochar carbonized at high-temperature showed remarkable performance for use as supercapacitors, CO2 adsorbents, and persulfate activation, due to its graphitic carbon structure, high electron transport, and specific surface area. The algal biochar produced by pyrolysis at moderate-temperature exhibits high performance for adsorption of pollutants due to combination of miscellaneous functional groups and porous structures, whereas coal fuel can be obtained from algae via torrefaction by pyrolysis at relatively low-temperature. The aim of this review is to study the production of algal biochar in a cost-effective and environmental-friendly method and to reduce the environmental pollution associated with bioenergy generation, achieving zero emission energy production. © 2020 The Author","Algae; Algal residue; Biochar; Pyrolysis; Thermochemical processes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090483239

Details of a study on the effect of Ce concentrations in the range of 5–15 wt% were also investigated. The results showed that 5 wt% Ce was an optimum concentration for the esterification and transesterification of CFSO with approximately 93% free fatty acid (FFA) conversion. High FFA conversion by 5Ce/ACcs-S is attributed to it having a sufficient amount of acid-base and noticeable pore structures. The effect of four variables (i.e., methanol to chicken fat oil, catalyst loading, reaction time, and temperature) on the FFA conversion was studied via the one-variable–at-a-time method.

In this work, hydrothermal carbon (HC), with a large specific surface area and plenty of oxygen-containing functional groups, was derived from sucrose via a hydrothermal method, which could facilitate the dispersion and anchoring of Ni. The selectivities to 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF), 2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran (DMTHF), and 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) were tuned by modulating Ni nanoparticle sizes and Ni/NiO ratios. The yield of BHMF can reach 88% with its selectivity up to 94% on the reduced 10%-Ni/HC catalyst with big Ni particle size; while the total yield of DMF + DMTHF is up to 94.6% at full HMF conversion on the calcined 5%-Ni/HC catalyst with small Ni particle sizes and balanced Ni/NiO ratios; for the calcined Ni/HC catalysts, the synergistic effect between Ni(0), favoring H2 activation and hydrogenation, and NiO, facilitating the hydrogenolysis of C–O bonds, could promote the selective hydrogenolysis of HMF to biofuel production (DMF and DMTHF).

To address this drawback, CaO is decorated into wollastonite to prepare the stable Ca/wollastonite catalyst. Microwave-assisted transesterification is used to produce biodiesel from palm oil, which effectively accelerates the reaction rate and improves the conversion efficiency. The Ca/wollastonite-0.8 catalyst with the mass ratio of CaO to wollastonite of 0.8 performs well with the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) yield of 97.59%. Also, this catalyst is highly stable, where the FAME yield of 87.30% could be obtained for the fifth reused cycle. CaO is evenly dispersed on the wollastonite surface and the total basicity is high to 0.281 mmol g−1. Meanwhile, transesterification parameters are optimized by response surface methodology with central composite design (RSM-CCD) and the maximum FAME yield of 98.46% is achieved at reaction temperature of 64.2 °C, molar ratio of methanol to palm oil of 15.54 and mass ratio of catalyst to palm oil of 9.21 wt% for 3 h. Besides, the mass ratio of catalyst to palm oil is the primary variable.

Although SiO2–TiO2 is a conventional binary system which usually fabricated by the sol–gel method, the comprehensive study requires on their structure to achieve the suitable properties. Therefore, a series of SO42−/SiO2–TiO2 was synthesized by combining sol–gel and impregnation methods. The effects of Si/Ti molar ratio (0.7, 0.8, 0.9, and 1), and nitric acid concentration as complex agent (2, 4, and 6 M) in the sol–gel method, and sulfate concentration (0.5, 1, and 2 M) in the impregnation method were evaluated. The results revealed that Si‒O‒Ti bands were fully formed and the high amount of nitric acid concentration has an insignificant effect on the silica–titania framework structure. After loading a sulfate group, TiOSO4 was formed as a highly active structure, leading to increasing the acidity of the sample. However, this structure was transformed to form Ti2(SO4)3 at higher sulfate concentration that has an insignificant influence on the activity of the catalyst. The optimum sample (Si/Ti ratio of 0.8, the nitric acid concentration of 4 M, and sulfate concentration of 1 M) presented a high activity in the esterification reaction. 94.1% of oleic acid was converted at the conditions of 120 °C, 3 wt% of catalyst, methanol/FFA molar ratio of 9, and 4 h of reaction time.

However, catalysts that are active and selective on model compounds for lignin fail when applied to real lignin with respect to performance and reaction mechanism. Here, we report kinetic data based on atomizing aqueous solutions of waste lignin, guaiacol, and syringaldehyde in a continuous catalytic fixed bed reactor operating at atmospheric pressure, a 5 s residence time, and a 30 mL min-1 (1:2 Ar:H2) volumetric flow rate (STP). The catalyst, NiMoS2 supported on activated carbon, was synthesized by a microemulsion technique and exhibited a combination of weak, strong, and very strong acid sites. Syringaldehyde reacted mostly to liquid products, and conversion increased with time-on-stream from 42% to 72% after 5 h. The main products were 2,6-dimethoxy-4-methylphenol and 1,6 dimethoxyphenol through hydrodeoxygenation and decarbonylation, respectively. Guaiacol conversion decreased with time-on-stream and ranged from 76% to 62% after 5 h. The main product was toluene via catechol, cresol, and phenol as intermediates. We propose reaction pathways for both syringaldehyde and guaiacol. The liquid fraction produced from the conversion of waste lignin contained 16 compounds that were mostly organic acids, followed by aldehydes, alcohols, and ketones. © 2020 American Chemical Society.","Biofuels; Depolymerization; Fixed bed reactor; Guaiacol; Lignin; Syringaldehyde","Alcohols; Atmospheric movements; Atmospheric pressure; Biofuels; Catalysts; Chemical reactors; Ketones; Microemulsions; Nickel compounds; Phenols; Catalytic fixed bed reactors; Continuous flow reactors; Hydrodeoxygenation; Microemulsion technique; Reaction mechanism; Reaction pathways; Specialty chemicals; Volumetric flow rate; Lignin; Barometric Pressure; Conversion; Guaiacol; Lignins; Liquids; Syringaldehyde; Wastes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092177252

The sodium cation in the crude red-mud was exchanged with barium and calcium cations and further tested to explore their role in oil upgrading. The relationship between red-mud catalytic activity and its constituents was explored using synthetic sodalite. The red-mud catalysts exhibited a considerable aromatisation capacity compared to the thermal co-pyrolysis, as the selectivity towards monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons increased from 12.7 to 19.6%, respectively. Long-chain molecules cracking was more significant in synthetic sodalite associated with their acidic active sites. The addition of barium and calcium cations to the red-mud largely improved oxygen elimination as a result of the enhanced catalyst basicity. In contrast, the aromatisation ability of red-mud significantly impeded by the large cation size (Ba2+ and Ca2+) due to the limited diffusion of pyrolysis vapours to the active sites. Ba-exchanged red-mud catalysts reduced the content of carboxylic acids in the bio-oil to 1.8 % while maintained a high yield of the organic fraction (34 %). Ca-exchanged red-mud catalysts produced the lowest fraction of oxygenated compounds (35.1 %); however, the organic phase yield was as low as 23.6 %. The modified red-mud catalysts reduced the fraction of oxygenated compounds from 69.9–35.1% during the biomass-plastic co-pyrolysis. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Bio-oil; Catalytic pyrolysis; Deoxygenation; Red-mud","Aromatic hydrocarbons; Barium; Calcium; Catalyst activity; Catalyst selectivity; Nanocatalysts; Positive ions; Pyrolysis; Biomass plastics; Calcium cations; Long chain molecules; Modified reds; Monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Organic fractions; Oxygenated compounds; Sodium cations; Municipal solid waste; aromatic hydrocarbon; barium ion; biofuel; calcium ion; carboxylic acid; oil; oxygen; polyethylene; sodium ion; zeolite; biofuel; aromatic hydrocarbon; barium; calcium; catalyst; cation; municipal solid waste; pyrolysis; red soil; sodalite; valorization; Article; biomass; catalysis; catalyst; chemical reaction; controlled study; diffusion; mine tailings; molecular dynamics; municipal solid waste; nanocatalyst; particle size; porosity; pyrolysis; red mud; solid waste management; valorization; heat; solid waste; Biofuels; Biomass; Catalysis; Hot Temperature; Porosity; Pyrolysis; Solid Waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083441206

To overcome these limitations, we synthesized a novel catalyst via calcination of pineapple leaves waste. This catalyst was characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and soluble alkalinity measurements. The catalyst's activity with regards to soybean oil transesterification was analyzed, and multiple process parameters (temperature, catalyst amount, reaction time, and methanol:oil molar ratio) were examined. A high catalytic activity, probably related to the 85 wt% content of alkali/alkali metals (K, Ca and Mg), was observed after a 30 min reaction time, 60 °C, 4 wt% of catalyst, oil to methanol molar ratio of 1:40, reaching an oil to biodiesel conversion above 98%.

This work compared the conversion of the extracted oil from the freshwater microalgae Scenedesmus rubescens via transesterification for the production of biodiesel. Considering the cost of biodiesel production, heterogeneous catalysts present a significant advantage because of their stability and reusability. Biochar and modified biochar with H2SO4 were used as catalysts. RESULTS: Biochar (BC) was pyrolyzed at 850 °C, under limited oxygen conditions, and was activated by sulphuric acid (H–BC). The catalyst: oil mass ratios tested were from 0 to 0.7:1 for BC, and from 0 to 1:1 for H–BC. The biochar sample exhibited a strong buffer capacity in the pH range between 7 and 5.5, while the acid treated biochar was strongly acidic and could neutralize a significant amount of bases. The produced methyl esters are almost the same in all cases examined. BC samples gave better transesterification results, as far as it concerns the conversion, compared to H–BC. CONCLUSION: The enhanced activity of the BC with mass used may be correlated with the basic minerals presented on the biochar surface. Raw biochar gave better conversion results (47%) during transesterification compared to the modified biochar with H2SO4 (24%) with better catalyst to molar ratio, 0.7:1 and 0.1:1, respectively. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry","algal biomass; biochar; oxidized biochar; biodiesel; transesterification","Algae; Catalysts; Chemical industry; Microorganisms; Molar ratio; Reusability; Transesterification; Acid treated; Biodiesel production; Biofuel production; Buffer capacity; Freshwater microalgae; Heterogeneous catalyst; Methyl esters; Scenedesmus rubescens; Biodiesel; biochar; biodiesel; buffer; charcoal; lipid; sulfuric acid; unclassified drug; Article; biomass; catalyst; fine root; malt; nonhuman; pH; pyrolysis; Scenedesmus; Scenedesmus rubescens; transesterification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083489880

One of the current limitations of the biofuel production by using MnO2 nanoparticles as catalyst is given by the reaction conditions. This work intends to improve the transesterification reaction efficiency through the use of a microwave field. It can generate large quantities of energy that lead to a good molecular motion thus favoring the transesterification process without altering the molecular structure. The aim of the present research is to explore the possibility of carrying out the microwave-assisted transesterification of grapes residues and seeds oil through the use of MnO2 nanoparticles as catalysts, as well as yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), to efficiently obtain biofuel end product. Methods: Both chemically and biochemically (using plant extracts) synthesized MnO2 nanoparticles were produced and characterized by different techniques like TEM, XRD, BET, XPS, VSM. The analysis of obtained biofuel was performed by GC–MS. Results: The comparison of results revealed that the samples prepared using plant extracts have morphologic properties higher than chemically prepared sample. MnO2 nanoparticles obtained by the use of oregano extracts were further tested for microwave assisted transesterification studies. Conclusions: The surface area of the MnO2 nanoparticles biochemically synthesized was four times higher than the nanoparticles synthesized by chemical method. The MnO2-oregano nanoparticles presented the best catalytic activity for biodiesel production as compared to the yeast catalyst. The use of microwave field for transesterification further enhances the efficiency of the process.

Biomass has shown great potential as green energy source with supply of approximately 14% of world total energy demand, and great source of carbon capture. It is abundant in various forms including agricultural, forestry residues, and unwanted plants (weeds). The rapid growth of weeds not only affects the yield of the crop, but also has strong consequences on the environment. These weeds can grow with minimum nutrient input requirements, have strong ability to grow at various soil and climate environments with high value of cellulose, thus can be valuable source of energy production. Results: Parthenium hysterophorus L. and Cannabis sativa L. have been employed for the production of biofuels (biogas, biodiesel and biochar) through nano-catalytic gasification by employing Co and Ni as nanocatalysts. Nanocatalysts were synthesized through well-established sol-gel method. SEM study confirms the spherical morphology of the nanocatalysts with size distribution of 20-50 nm. XRD measurements reveal that fabricated nanocatalysts have pure standard crystal structure without impurity. During gasification of Cannabis sativa L., we have extracted the 53.33% of oil, 34.66% of biochar and 12% gas whereas in the case of Parthenium hysterophorus L. 44% oil, 38.36% biochar and 17.66% of gas was measured. Electrical conductivity in biochar of Cannabis sativa L. and Parthenium hysterophorus L. was observed 0.4 dSm-1 and 0.39 dSm-1, respectively. Conclusion: Present study presents the conversion of unwanted plants Parthenium hysterophorus L. and Cannabis sativa L. weeds to biofuels. Nanocatalysts help to enhance the conversion of biomass to biofuel due to large surface reactivity. Our findings suggest potential utilization of unwanted plants for biofuel production, which can help to share the burden of energy demand. Biochar produced during gasification can replace chemical fertilizers for soil remediation and to enhance the crop productivity. © 2020 The Author(s).","Biochar; Biofuel; Biomass; Nano-catalytic gasification; Weeds","Agricultural robots; Crops; Crystal impurities; Crystal structure; Energy management; Energy policy; Fertilizers; Gasification; Hemp; Morphology; Nanocatalysts; Renewable energy resources; Soil conservation; Soil pollution; Sol-gel process; Sol-gels; Biofuel production; Catalytic gasification; Chemical fertilizers; Crop productivity; Electrical conductivity; Green energy sources; Renewable energy source; Spherical morphologies; Biofuels; biochar; biofuel; biomass; catalysis; cobalt; nickel; weed; Anatomy; Crystal Structure; Farm Crops; Fertilizers; Gasification; Hemp; Cannabis sativa; Parthenium hysterophorus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092268114

The use of MFCs for energy generation from wastewater biofuels through electrochemically active bacteria as biocatalysts has been accepted in the recent past. The power output of MFCs depends upon the electrode material, pH of the medium, temperature, internal and external impedance, and redox potentials of cathodic and anodic chambers. The current review highlights the importance of tuning these parameters for improving the energy generation efficiency of MFCs. Because every technology has associated merits and demerits, thus, to avoid offering details of only success stories, here an effort has been made to critically discuss the recent progress and challenges in the applicability of MFCs as an energy generation source and water purification technology. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Purification; Redox reactions; Bioelectrochemical devices; Electrochemically active bacteria; Electrode material; Energy generations; Microbial fuel cells (MFCs); Organic substrate; Sustainable energy; Water purification technologies; Microbial fuel cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091464724

Thus, the influence of concentration of catalyst, MeOH:HBO molar ratio, reaction time and reaction temperature on the HBOME yield was identified using Taguchi orthogonal array design approach. Also, the overall reaction rate constant (k) and reaction order (n) for the process was determined as a way to develop a kinetic model. The results showed that HBOME yield of 96.97 wt% could be achieved using catalyst amount of 3.5 wt%, MeOH:HBO molar ratio of 6:1, reaction time of 75 min and reaction temperature of 65 °C. Performance evaluation of the process input variables suggests reaction time had the highest influence on the HBOME yield. The values of n and k were determined to be 1 and 0.0034 min−1, respectively via kinetic modeling of the transesterification process. The cetane number, kinematic viscosity and acid value of the HBOME produced were 59.54 ± 0.15, 4.98 ± 0.12 mm2/s and 0.22 ± 0.00 mg KOH/g oil, respectively, which compared well with the standard specifications for biodiesel.

However, due to complexity in structure, its pretreatment is essentially required prior to actual use. In the present study, a promising approach has been proposed through the development of acid-functionalized magnetic nanocatalysts. Two different acid-functionalized magnetic nanocatalysts i.e. alkylsulfonic acid functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4-MNPs-Si-AS) and butylcarboxylic acid functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4-MNPs-Si-BCOOH) were developed and their efficacy was studied in the pretreatment of sugarcane straw at varying concentrations (100, 200, 300, 400, 500 mg/g of straw). The enhanced concentration dependent production of sugar (xylose) was reported in case of both the nanocatalysts. The maximum 17.06 g/L for Fe3O4-MNPs-Si-AS and 15.40 g/L for Fe3O4-MNPs-Si-BCOOH sugar was reported at 500 mg which is comparatively higher than normal acid (H2SO4) (14.63 g/L) and non-treated (0.24 g/L) sugarcane straw. Further, both the nanocatalysts were recovered by applying an external magnetic field and reused for the next two subsequent cycles of pretreatment. It was observed that with every reuse of nanocatalysts the concentration of sugar production was reduced. Moreover, generation of very less amount of toxic inhibitors was reported in the hemicellulosic hydrolyzate obtained in the present study. Considering these facts, it is believed that such nanocatalysts can be used as an effective, eco-friendly and economically viable alternative to the conventional pretreatment agents like mineral acids. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Acid functionalized magnetic nanoparticles; Lignocellulosic biomass; Nanocatalysts; Pretreatment; Reuse; Sugarcane straw","Bioethanol; Cellulosic ethanol; Cost effectiveness; Earth (planet); Environmental protection; Iron oxides; Lignocellulosic biomass; Magnetism; Magnetite; Nanocatalysts; Silicon; Sugar industry; Acid-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles; Concentration-dependent; Cost-effective approach; Economic viability; Economically viable; External magnetic field; Hemicellulosic hydrolyzate; Pretreatment agents; Magnetic nanoparticles; Cost Effectiveness; Inorganic Acids; Iron Oxides; Magnetic Properties; Pretreatment; Production; Silicon; Straw",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085890174

Undesired biomass (weed) from agricultural fields can be used to produce biofuels through nano catalysts enhanced gasification and process. Lignocellulosic part of weedy plants represents a potential alternative feedstock for economic production of bioethanol. Large numbers of weedy plant species are growing all over the world. However, high energy requirements and poor-quality biofuel products are the major constraints for utilization of this technology. Nanomaterials could be used as a catalyst to enhance the energy use efficiency and product quality. So, present study was conducted to produce bio-gas, bio-diesel and bio-char from mixed weed biomass of weeds like Carthamous oxyacantha, Asphodelus tenuifolius and Chenopodium album through gasification process using nano-materials as catalysts. Nickel and cobalt nano-particles were used as nano-catalysts to expedite the bio-chemical reactions for the generation of these products at lower temperatures i.e. (400 C°) in a muffle furnace. Further, these products were characterized using GC-MS analysis. It was observed that biodiesel contained 65.47% esters, which indicates its better quality than the normally produced biodiesel having 15–20% esters contents. Similarly, GC-MS analysis of biogas produced from mixed weed biomass showed 3.76% Methane, 8.32% Propane, 50.16% Ethene, 3.12% Propyne and 34.64% Methanol. The present results clearly exhibited the improved product quality and better energy use efficiency in gasification of weed biomass for bioenergy production. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bio-energy; Biochar; Characterization; Gasification; Nano-catalyst; Weed biomass","Agricultural robots; Biodiesel; Bioethanol; Biogas; Biomass; Climate change; Esters; Ethylene; Feedstocks; Fossil fuels; Gasification; Lignocellulosic biomass; Nanoparticles; Quality control; Alternative energy source; Alternative feedstocks; Asphodelus tenuifolius; Bioenergy productions; Biofuels production; Energy-use efficiency; Gasification process; High energy requirements; Nanocatalysts; alternative energy; bioenergy; biofuel; biogas; biomass; catalyst; chemical reaction; detection method; energy efficiency; fossil fuel; temperature effect; Asphodelus tenuifolius; Chenopodium album",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085746182

To reduce the coke formation, binary compound impregnation (BCI) and chemical liquid deposition (CLD) were used to modify HZSM-5 catalysts. At the same time, the self-designed microwave reactor separated the pyrolysis of bamboo and catalytic upgrading of primary vapor, which made the catalytic effect more thorough. Experimental results indicated that CLD used TiO2 deposition to cover external acid sites, while BCI by phosphorus-nickel could cover and partly destroy superficial acid sites through two different ways. Within the scope of the loaded amount studied, the yield of aromatic hydrocarbons in the oil phase increased at first and then decreased, while the coke formation reduced continuously.

Approaches to improving the oxidative stability of biofuels include the addition of antioxidants, mixing of vegetable oils or modification of the fatty ester profile. This work aimed to evaluate the physicochemical properties of biodiesel synthesized from Tilapia oil and its oxidative degradation process after addition of both natural ethanolic extract of turmeric (Curcuma longa Linn.) and synthetics butylated hydroxyl anisole (BHA), butylated hydroxyl toluene (BHT), propyl gallate (PG) antioxidants. In addition, some thermodynamic and kinetic parameters were obtained in order to determine the activation energy during the biodiesel oxidation process from different temperatures. The physicochemical properties of biodiesel obtained after the addition of antioxidants are in accordance with current regulations, which suggests it as an excellent alternative source for the biofuel industry. The oxidative stability showed that the natural antioxidant has the best response in control of oxidative process compared to the other synthetic antioxidants. The kinetic study showed the addition of natural antioxidant to biodiesel increases the activation energy (Ea) hindering its oxidation process.

This study was aimed at developing a mini production line consisting of sequential conversion, extraction and purification of biodiesel from Scenedesmus acuminatus S4 grown in domestic wastewater. RESULTS: The data showed that the separated conversion-extraction (SCE) produced biodiesel with high yield (99.9%) and purity (87.5%) at 200 g L–1 biomass loading, 5% H2SO4/methanol (v/v) catalyst loading, 100 °C reaction temperature and 200 rpm stirring rate, in a 1 h conversion reaction, followed by extraction with hexane (10 mL:1 g dry cell weight) by mixing for 10 min (200 rpm) at 25 °C. The integrated conversion-extraction (ICE) performed by simultaneous addition of hexane to the biomass and the catalytic solution mixture under the optimized conditions, achieved biodiesel yield and purity of 91.9% and 81.4%, respectively. Crude biodiesel was purified by 40% (w/v) adsorbents [Magnesol and D-sol® (D60)]/crude biodiesel achieving &gt;95% fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) purity, which is superior to the results in the literature and equivalent to fuel grade standard. CONCLUSIONS: Fuel grade biodiesel was successfully produced from S. acuminatus S4 via sequential steps of direct conversion, extraction and purification. The conversion step can be performed via SCE or ICE followed by extraction to obtain crude biodiesel (99% yield and 87.5% purity), whereas the purification step was implemented by dry-washing with Magnesol or D-sol® (D60) to &gt;95% FAME.

Silica was extracted from rice husk by ion exchange method and subsequently impregnated with CaO. The experimental results showed that the supported catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic activity in transesterification of waste cooking oil with high yield of biodiesel, comparable to that of CaO catalyst. This is due to the fact that catalyst with higher surface area produces higher biodiesel yield. The presence of water did not have significant effect on the performance of supported catalysts, as silica can act as catalyst to esterify the FFA. Furthermore, silica support offered the greatest extent of leaching minimization of CaO and it has been proved that the calcium leached species was insignificant in transesterification reaction. Reusability study suggests that the synthesized catalysts can be recycled up for 8 successive runs.

The effect of different sonication times (15, 30 and 45 min) on nanocatalyst properties were studied using BET, EDX, FESEM, NH3-TPD, FTIR and XRD analyses. The XRD patterns along with the results of FTIR and BET analysis revealed the MCM-41 framework destruction while Zr doping and sulfation of nanocatalysts. The FESEM images of the nanocatalysts illustrated a well distribution and uniform morphology for the SZM(T = 45). The size distribution of the SZM(T = 45) were subsequently determined by FESEM images. Biodiesel production carried out under following constant operational parameters to evaluate catalytic performance of synthesized samples: 5 wt% catalyst loading, 60 °C reaction temperature, methanol/oil molar ratio of 9:1 and 6 h reaction time. Using ultrasound-assisted sulfation method in nanocatalysts preparation was increased dispersion of active phase and stability of synthesized nanocatalysts. Obtained results demonstrated that longer irradiation time in nanocatalyst preparation led to higher biodiesel conversion. Additionally, after five cycles, the sonicated sample showed higher reusability compared to non-sonicated one. Among the prepared samples, the longer sonicated SZM(T = 45) nanocatalyst showed the highest conversion (93.5%) and significant stability in biodiesel production. Graphic Abstract: Sono-sulfated zirconia nanocatalyst supported on MCM-41 was synthesized by an ultrasound-assisted impregnation/hydrothermal hybrid synthesis method. The effect of irradiation time was studied by changing time of the sonication (15, 30, 45 min) during the synthesis which led to different physiochemical properties of the nanocatalyst. It was found that, the performance of investigated nanocatalysts in biodiesel production from sunflower oil showed sonicated catalysts have higher conversion in comparison to non-sonicated catalyst.

The increase in the global energy demand has pushed up the production of biodiesel with a corresponding increase in glycerol production over the years. The thermo-catalytic process is gaining wide popularity as sustainable technical routes of converting glycerol to renewable hydrogen. There exists a great potential of utilizing hydrogen as a critical part of a more sustainable and secure energy mix. Hence, this study focusses on the review of the recent advances and development in the thermo-catalytic conversion of glycerol to renewable hydrogen in the last one decade. The analysis of the reviewed articles showed that substantial efforts had been made in the application of thermo-catalytic process for the conversion of glycerol to renewable hydrogen. Glycerol reforming using steam, carbon dioxide (CO2) and oxygen (O2) have received significant research attention and have been found to have great potential as technological routes for hydrogen production. Whereas, the use of the photocatalytic glycerol reforming has the advantages of energy-saving by utilizing the vast available solar resources and suitable photocatalysts. However, each of the thermo-catalytic processes exhibits inherent challenges which have been a bottleneck to the development of the process to industrial scales.

The organics in bio-oil serve as the feedstock for the production of hydrogen, chemicals, biofuels, and carbon materials. In many processes for conversion of bio-oil, heating is required. The thermal treatment of bio-oil induces the polymerization/cracking of the organics in bio-oil, producing coke. Coke could lower the carbon conversion efficiency of bio-oil, clog the reactor chamber, and deactivate the catalyst, imposing the main challenge for the utilization of bio-oil involving the heating of bio-oil. This review investigates the coking issues in the processes for bio-oil upgrading including esterification, hydrotreatment, catalytic pyrolysis, pyrolysis, steam reforming, and the process for the conversion of bio-oil to carbon materials. The properties of coke formed from thermal treatment of bio-oil, the mechanism for coking of bio-oil, and the methods developed for tackling the coking of bio-oil are the focus. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon; Catalytic reforming; Coking properties; Heat treatment; Hydrogen production; Pyrolysis; Steam reforming; Carbon conversions; Carbon material; Catalytic pyrolysis; Coke formation; Hydrotreatment; Organics; Production of hydrogen; Reactor chamber; Coke",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089812238

Ag[sbnd]Pd catalysts prepared by various methods and containing different Ag:Pd ratio were investigated in this context. By combining activity tests, characterization of the main physicochemical properties of the catalysts and DFT study of formic acid decomposition, the key factors responsible for the activity of Ag[sbnd]Pd catalysts in both the formic acid decomposition and the subsequent hydrogenation of levulinic acid were specified. Pd is shown to be active, but prone to poisoning by CO, while the CO poisoning remains limited on diluted Ag[sbnd]Pd alloy with strong intermetallic interaction, where its adsorption is very weak thanks to the isolation of Pd atoms. Therefore, the catalyst containing 4%Ag-1%Pd/AlOOH showed the highest selectivity in formic acid decomposition as well as the highest activity in levulinic acid hydrogenation (34% conversion in 5 h at 190 °C). © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Ag–Pd catalysts; Biomass; DFT study; Formic acid; Hydrogen transfer; Levulinic acid","Catalyst selectivity; Catalyst supports; Formic acid; Hydrogenation; Physicochemical properties; CO poisoning; DFT study; Equimolar amount; Formic acid decompositions; Hydrogen sources; Levulinic acid; Pd alloy; Pd catalyst; Palladium alloys; Adsorption; Atoms; Catalysts; Conversion; Formic Acid; Hydrogenation; Hydrolysis; Levulinic Acid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085202872

Here, several bimetallic Ni-M/Nb2O5 catalysts (M = Fe, Co, Cu) were synthesized and evaluated in the HDO of biofuel precursors (aldol adduct of furfural with acetone) to liquid alkane and it was found that Ni-Cu/Nb2O5 has the best performance (86.5% yield of octane and 5.1% yield of heptane). Various characterization techniques show that Ni-Cu alloy is formed over the Ni-Cu/Nb2O5 catalyst, which may have the main active metal sites. Moreover, the Ni-Cu alloy has more sites for the adsorption-activation of H2, leading to the high activity. During the HDO process, the ring-opening of the intermediate butyl-tetrahydrofuran (BTHF) and the conversion of octanol are two rate-determining steps. The kinetic study confirms that the ring-opening of BTHF over Ni-Cu/Nb2O5 is more favorable than that over Ni/Nb2O5. More importantly, the Ni-Cu alloy significantly restrained the undesirable decarbonylation due to the weak adsorption of carbonyl, which was key for the efficient production of Cn alkanes.

They were characterized using various techniques (N2 sorption isotherms, XRD, SEM-EDX, XPS, H2-TPR, NH3-TPD) and evaluated in the selective deoxygenation of sunflower oil using a semi-batch reactor (310 ◦C, 40 bar of hydrogen, 96 mL/min hydrogen flow rate, and 100 mL/1 g reactant to catalyst ratio). The severe control of the co-precipitation procedure and the direct reduction (without previous calcination) of precursor samples resulted in mesoporous nano-structured catalysts (most of the pores in the range 3–5 nm) exhibiting a high surface area (192–285 m2 g-1). The promoting action of copper is demonstrated for the first time for catalysts with a very small Cu/Ni weight ratio (0.02–0.09). The effect is more pronounced in the catalyst with the medium copper content (58Ni2CuAl) where a 17.2% increase of green diesel content in the liquid products has been achieved with respect to the non-promoted catalyst. The copper promoting action was attributed to the increase in the nickel dispersion as well as to the formation of a Ni-Cu alloy being very rich in nickel. A portion of the Ni-Cu alloy nanoparticles is covered by Ni0 and Cu0 nanoparticles in the 59Ni1CuAl and 55Ni5CuAl catalysts, respectively. The maximum promoting action observed in the 58Ni2CuAl catalyst was attributed to the finding that, in this catalyst, there is no considerable masking of the Ni-Cu alloy by Ni0 or Cu0. The relatively low performance of the 55Ni5CuAl catalyst with respect to the other promoted catalysts was attributed, in addition to the partial coverage of Ni-Cu alloy by Cu0, to the remarkably low weak/moderate acidity and relatively high strong acidity exhibited by this catalyst. The former favors selective deoxygenation whereas the latter favors coke formation. Copper addition does not affect the selective-deoxygenation reactions network, which proceeds predominantly via the dehydration-decarbonylation route over all the catalysts studied. © 2020 by the authors.

The yield and quality of the biofuel are critically affected by the physicochemical properties of NiO supported on nanosized zeolite Y (Y65, crystal size of 65 nm). Therefore, 10 wt% NiO supported on Y65 synthesized by using impregnation (IM) and deposition-precipitation (DP) methods were investigated. It was found that preparation methods have a significant effect on the deoxygenation of triolein. The initial rate of the DP method (14.8 goil•h-1) was 1.5 times higher than that of the IM method (9.6 goil•h-1). The DP-Y65 showed the best deoxygenation performance with a 80.0% conversion and a diesel selectivity of 93.7% at 380 °C within 1 h. The outstanding performance from the DP method was due to the smaller NiO particle size (3.57 ± 0.40 nm), high accessibility (H. F value of 0.084), and a higher Bronsted to Lewis acidity (B/L) ratio (0.29), which has improved the accessibility and deoxygenation ability of the catalyst. The NH4+ released from the decomposition of the urea during the DP process increased the B/L ratio of zeolite NaY. As a result, the pretreatment to convert Na-zeolite to H-zeolite in a conventional zeolite synthesis can be avoided. In this regard, the DP method offers a one-pot synthesis to produce smaller NiO-supported nanosized zeolite NaY with a high B/L ratio, and it managed to produce a higher yield with selectivity towards green diesel via deoxygenation under a hydrogen-free condition. © 2020 by the authors.","Deposition-precipitation; Green diesel; NiO; Triolein; Zeolite Y","Binary alloys; Biofuels; Catalysts; Deposition; Diesel engines; Nickel oxide; Particle size; Physicochemical properties; Sodium alloys; Urea; Conventional zeolites; Deposition precipitation methods; Diesel selectivity; Nanosized zeolites; Nickel based catalysts; NiO nanoparticles; One-pot synthesis; Preparation method; Zeolites",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088529504

Black liquor is concentrated using Multiple Stage Evaporator, the utmost energy intensive unit, before using it as biofuel. Pertaining to the contemporary global energy scenario, improvement in energy efficiency of Multiple Stage Evaporator becomes indispensable. The present work investigates the non-linear modeling and simulation-based optimization of Heptads' stage based Multiple Stage Evaporator in backward feed flow configuration integrated with various energy saving strategies. A novel metaheuristic approach, Water Cycle Algorithm has been employed to search the optimum estimates of unknown process variables and therefore, the optimum energy efficiency parameters.

The CTH of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) and furfural to 2-methylfuran (MF) was thoroughly studied over the Ru, Pd, Au, Pt, Ni, Rh and Cu metal catalysts supported on nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbons (NMCs) by utilizing 2-propanol as a source of hydrogen. The structural characteristics of the materials were examined by employing various physico-chemical methods, such as XRD, N2 sorption, CHN analysis, XPS, FT-IR spectroscopy, H2-TPR, TEM, CO2-TPD, ICP-OES and Raman spectroscopy. The influence of the N content, basicity of the catalyst, reaction temperature, hydrogen donor, nature of the catalyst support and transition metal was systematically investigated with regard to the substrate conversions and product yields. The correlation between the N content (wt%) of the catalysts and the Ru nanoparticle size (nm) and turnover frequency (h-1) was also investigated. Highly dispersed Ru nanoparticles (1.9 nm) supported on NMC displayed admirable catalytic performance in CTH for the conversion of HMF to DMF and furfural to MF. The catalyst Ru-NMC with a good N content (11.4 wt%) gave 84 and 87 mol% yields of DMF and MF, respectively, with 2-propanol as the source of hydrogen under mild reaction conditions. In addition, this catalyst demonstrated excellent recyclability. The better catalytic activity of the Ru-NMC catalyst in the CTH of HMF and furfural was credited to the small size of the Ru metal nanoparticles (1.9 nm), high N content, superior metal-support interaction and mesoporous framework of the catalyst. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Aldehydes; Alkalinity; Catalyst activity; Chemical analysis; Doping (additives); Furfural; Hydrogen; Hydrogenation; Metal nanoparticles; Nanocatalysts; Ruthenium; Transition metals; 5 hydroxymethyl furfurals; Catalytic performance; Catalytic transfer hydrogenation; Metal-support interactions; Mild reaction conditions; Nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbons; Physicochemical methods; Structural characteristics; Catalyst supports; biomass burning; catalysis; catalyst; energy efficiency; hydrogen; nanoparticle; performance assessment; reaction kinetics; rubidium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087543099

Combustion synthesis was used as a facile and low cost preparation route for fabrication of all nanocatalysts’ support because of suitable porosity for the biodiesel production reaction. For this purpose, the samples were analysed by XRD, FESEM, EDX, BET-BJH, and FTIR and then used in the transesterification reaction.

The catalysts exhibit superior catalytic performance for the hydrodeoxygenation of HMF to DMF, obtaining 100% HMF conversion and 92.9% selectivity to DMF under 1.0 MPa H2 at 180 °C for 2 h. The reaction pathway is also investigated, which shows that the hydrogenolysis of the C=O bond in HMF to form 2,5-dihydroxymethylfuran is the main route during the hydrodeoxygenation and promoted by the synergistic effect of Pt and Co. Pt1/Co SAA catalysts display excellent stability without aggregation after five successive runs. More inspiringly, our method achieves the mass production of Pt1/Co at the kilogram scale, rendering its potential for practical applications. Moreover, by varying acetylacetonate precursors, we show the general synthesis of different Co-supported noble metal SAA catalysts (M1/Co, M = Pd, Ru, Ir, and Rh).

The Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction with its extraordinary chemoselectivity is advantageous for the hydrogenation process, compared to the molecular-hydrogen-based process using noble metal catalysts. Therefore, we used a classical Al-based isopropoxide to catalyze transfer hydrogenation (CHT) of methyl levulinate (ML) to GVL. A high yield of GVL up to 97.6% could be achieved using 2-proponal as the H-donor and solvent under mild conditions (150 °C, 30 min). Besides, three reaction stages were observed in the conversion, including transesterification, hydrogenation and cyclization. LC/MS analysis and the density functional theory (DFT) caculations revealed that Al atom of Al(OiPr)3 as the electron transfer center activated ester carbonyl of the substrate via four-membered transition states before activating the ketone carbonyl, resulting in the occurrence of transesterification prior to the hydrogenation. In addition, 2-propanol as proton transfer carrier assisting the cyclization process was proved to be the lowest-energy pathway.

Heterogeneous solid sulfonic acid catalysts can be easily achievedviathe post-sulfonation strategy. These porous materials have preferable surface areas, ordered hollow pore structures, and accessible acidic sites, and they serve as promising catalysts for biodiesel production. This study provides insights into the production of template- and metal-free based catalysts for biofuel production, which is imperative for the green and efficient design and manufacture of high-activity heterogeneous catalysts. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.",,"Biodiesel; Manufacture; Morphology; Nanospheres; Polymers; Pore structure; Synthetic fuels; Advanced applications; Biodiesel production; Biodiesel synthesis; Biofuel production; Heterogeneous catalyst; Heterogeneous solid; Morphology and size; Polymeric nanospheres; Catalyst activity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089795913

The bioelectrocatalysis has been widely explored by the research community in various aspects. Enzymes can catalyze different chemical reactions in living organisms by enzymes as the most important biological catalysts. These enzymatic biocatalysts are commercially available and commonly called enzyme electrodes. Electron transfer between the active center of the enzyme and the electrode can be performed either by direct electron transfer (DET) or by means of mediators (i.e. mediated electron transfer (MET), which are discussed in details in the review presented. Therefore, different strategies have been used to increase the efficiency and stability of bioelectrocatalysis. In this review, different strategies of the bioelectrode designs are discussed and the application of the common bioelectrodes used in the biosensors are presented in the various fields.

New bimetallic Ni3Fe catalysts were developed for effective hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of Py-oil derived from date seeds. Ni3Fe catalyst showed a well-defined octagon-like morphology with a diameter of 120 nm and high saturation magnetization (Ms) of 78 emu g−1 at room temperature. Py-oil was subjected to catalytic HDO processes at 250 °C for 120 min in a 10 bar H2 atmosphere in the presence of Ni3Fe catalyst. Characterization results confirmed HDO of several components of Py-oil, including phenols, acids, aldehyde and ketones, sugars and aromatic hydrocarbons over the surfaces of Ni3Fe catalyst. The obtained upgraded Py-oil (HDO Py-oil) showed the highest hydrocarbons content of 23.77%, higher heating value (HHV) of 36.78 MJ kg−1, and lower content of water, total acid number, and viscosity than fresh Py-oil. Bimetallic Ni3Fe catalyst resulted in better HDO performance and re-usability for five consecutive cycles than recently reported monometallic or noble metal nanocatalysts. Plausible reaction pathways for the formation of major components including ethane, ethyl acetate, 2,5-dimethylfuran, D-sorbitol, methylcyclohexane, furfural alcohol, and 1,5-pentane diols are discussed.

In this work, a biorefinery approach of co-generation of bioethanol and bio-oil from rice straw that integrated separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) and hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) processes was proposed. SHF of dilute sulfuric acid pretreated rice straw gave a bioethanol concentration of 8.3 g/L with approximately 68% of theoretical yield. The maximum bio-oil yield 31.36 wt% via HTL of solid fermentation residues using bioethanol wastewater as the solvent was obtained under optimum conditions.

However, some effective parameters on their properties and performance must be deeply evaluated. Therefore, in this study, the effect of Ni/Al ratio on the properties and performance of Ni-NiAl2O4 catalyst synthesized by solution combustion method was investigated. The sulfated structure of the samples was used as solid acid catalysts for the esterification of oleic acid. Various characterization techniques were carried out on SO4 2−/Ni-NiAl2O4 composites, and the results revealed that the increase of nickel concentration led to the formation of NiO and metal Ni which bonded strongly with sulfate groups during the impregnation process. The strong bands between Ni cations and sulfate group increase sharply the surface area (from 28.6 m2 s−1 for Ni/Al ratio = 1 to 35.4 m2 s−1 for Ni/Al ratio = 1.75) and the activity of the samples, consequently. However, higher amounts of Ni cations (Ni/Al ratio of 2) led to agglomerated particles that were detected on the surface which filled the porosities. It can cause to reduce the surface area and activity of SO4/Ni-NiAl2O4 nanocatalyst. The sample fabricated by 1.75 times of Ni/Al ratio presented the highest surface area, pore diameter (the most of pores are greater than 8 nm), less roughness and uniform particle size that converted more than 95% of oleic acid to ester at the conditions of 120 °C, 9 molar ratio of methanol to oleic acid, 3 wt% of catalyst and 4 h of reaction time. It was also remained active for four uses and was successfully regenerated after deactivation by re-loading the sulfate group. © 2020, King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology.","Esterification; NiAl2O4; Re-generability; Solid acid catalyst; Solution combustion method","Biofuels; Esters; Fabrication; Molar ratio; Monounsaturated fatty acids; Nanocatalysts; Nickel oxide; Oleic acid; Particle size; Positive ions; Sodium Aluminate; Sulfur compounds; Agglomerated particles; Characterization techniques; Effective parameters; Esterification of oleic acids; Impregnation process; Nickel concentrations; Solid acid catalysts; Solution combustion method; Aluminum compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081277668

In order to avoid excessive exploitation of agricultural land for the production of food crop feedstock, the main focus has been on the usage of waste cooking oils meant for disposal to be used in biodiesel production. However, the high free fatty acid (FFA) content in waste oils has been an issue and it is envisaged that heterogeneous acid catalysts can be utilised as they would have a higher tolerance of FFAs and water. In this study, we report the synthesis and the utilisation of an inexpensive heterogeneous acid catalyst, namely ammonium ferric sulphate-calcium silicate (AFS-CS) synthesised via the impregnation method in 2:1 mass ratio in biodiesel production. The reaction conditions for esterification of lauric acid (LA) was optimised by using both standard and statistical analysis method which gave maximum methyl esters conversion of 100% within 2 h reaction time, 4 wt% of AFS-CS catalyst amount and 15:1 molar ratio of methanol to LA at 65 °C.

Then it was loaded by calcium through conventional impregnation and sono-dispersion. Synthesized nanocatalysts were analysed using EDX, XRD, FTIR, FESEM and BET-BJH techniques. The results of XRD technique revealed the fabrication of MCM-41 and CaO. The FESEM images proved that the surface particle sizes of the synthesized catalysts were in the range of nanoscale and EDX results represented that Ca was more effectively scattered over the support in sonicated samples compared to non-sonicated one. Also, both FESEM and BET-BJH analysis represented a decrease in MCM-41 specific surface area with Si/Zr molar ratio reduction. The catalytic performances of bifunctional samples were evaluated for transesterification and esterification reactions. The constant operational conditions were as follows: 70 °C, MeOH/Oil = 9 and 5 wt% catalyst. Generally, the obtained results demonstrated a remarkable improvement in biodiesel conversion due to an increase of Zr amounts in catalysts and also the sample which was exposed to ultrasound represented better reusability in comparison with the non-sonicated sample.

In this study, fungal strains (endophytic/free spores) were isolated from an estuarine ecosystem and screened for extracellular lipase activities. A novel fungal strain Cladosporium tenuissimum, identified through molecular technique exhibited higher lipolytic activity among the isolates. The crude lipase extracted from fungus was subjected to ammonium sulphate precipitation and purification using Superdex 200 gel filtration chromatographic system. The molecular weight of purified lipase was found to be ∼46 KDa and a specific activity of 37.2 U/mg. Lipase activities attained stability and reached maximum at 60 °C temperature and pH of 6. The purified enzyme was used as a biological catalyst for enzymatic transesterification of oil obtained from an indigenously isolated salt tolerant diatom Nitzschia punctata. Spectroscopic analysis on fatty acids and Fatty Acid Methyl Esters derived from diatom exhibited similarities in specific functional groups between algal oil and biodiesel. Comparisons on biodiesel yield estimation and FAME compositions of enzyme catalyzed, acid catalyzed biodiesel assessed through gas chromatographic techniques revealed a higher efficiency (87.2 ± 0.47%) of biocatalysts compared to conventional acid catalyst (83.02 ± 0.35%) exhibiting potential scope for large scale application of environment friendly biocatalysts to enhance the conversion performances of the transesterification process. © 2020","Biocatalyst; Diatom oil; Enzymatic transesterification; Fungal lipase; Microalgal biodiesel","Algae; Biocatalysts; Biodiesel; Catalysis; Ecosystems; Effluent treatment; Esters; Fatty acids; Fungi; Gas chromatography; Purification; Spectroscopic analysis; Sulfur compounds; Supercritical fluids; Transesterification; Chromatographic systems; Chromatographic techniques; Diatom oil; Enzymatic transesterification; Large-scale applications; Microalgal biodiesels; Specific functional groups; Transesterification process; Enzymes; ammonium sulfate; bioenergy; biofuel; biotechnology; catalyst; diatom; enzyme activity; microbial activity; algae; Bacillariophyta; Cladosporium tenuissimum; Fungi; Nitzschia punctata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079601966

Thiolate surfactants can greatly improve the overall yield; however, the dynamics of the reacting species and the reaction mechanism have remained unknown at the molecular scale. We elucidated the interaction of a series of aromatic compounds with octadecylthiolate-modified palladium nanocatalysts in atomic detail and explain large increases in product selectivity and yield through a detailed reaction mechanism. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal adsorption free energies on the order of -5 kcal/mol on the ligand-modified nanoparticles, which are significantly smaller than those on bare metal surfaces, where -10 to -30 kcal/mol are found. The ligands induce a two-step process of condensation in the ligand shell and adsorption, leading to upright molecular orientations, in contrast to single-step adsorption on bare metal surfaces. Exothermic condensation into the ligand shell and binding to the metal surface are accompanied by large entropy losses due to the reduced mobility in the ligand shell and increased confinement of the alkyl chains. Results from molecular dynamics simulations using the interface force field (IFF) show impressive agreement with available thermochemical reference data from experiments. Upright orientations of aromatic alcohol reactants lower the activation energy for the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) reaction and suppress competing decarbonylation reactions. The analysis of the HDO reaction mechanism by QM/MM calculations in the presence of the ligands as well as by DFT calculations under vacuum uncovers the acidic and basic properties of hydrogenated Pd surfaces. The rate-limiting step involves the transfer of Pd-bound hydrogen atoms to hydroxyl groups in the alcohol reactants. The mechanism explains prior experimental data and supports the rational design of metal and alloy catalysts of specific shape, ligand coverage, and reaction conditions for biomass upgrading.

Surface modification with (3-mercaptopropyl) trimethoxysilane followed by oxidation of sulfide groups led to the production of sulfonic acid sites on graphene oxide nanosheets. The results of various physicochemical techniques approved the synthesis of desired catalyst. The amount of acid sites was measured via the acid-base treatment with triethylamine which exhibited 1.07 mmol/g H+ in the catalyst structure. Two kinds of acid-catalyzed reactions i.e. esterification and acetalization were adopted to evaluate the catalytic performance of prepared catalyst. More than 90% conversion was achieved for butyl acetate production in acetic acid esterification with n-butanol. Moreover, methyl oleate as one of the main components of biodiesel was produced with good yield over the prepared catalyst via oleic acid esterification with methanol. The 1H NMR technique was also conducted to characterize and determine the amount of produced methyl oleate. Finally, the benzaldehyde acetalization with ethylene glycol was performed which high conversion (92%) was obtained at 3 h. The catalyst reusability for both esterification and acetalization reactions demonstrated the catalyst stability after five reaction cycles. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Acetalization; Biodiesel; Esterification; Graphene oxide; Solid acid catalyst; Sulfonic acid","Biodiesel; Catalysis; Catalysts; Esterification; Esters; Ethylene; Ethylene glycol; Graphene oxide; Reusability; Sulfur compounds; Synthetic fuels; Acetalization; Acid-catalyzed reactions; Functionalized graphene; Graphene oxide nanosheets; Oleic acid esterification; Physicochemical techniques; Solid acid catalysts; Sulfonic acid; Graphene; acetate; aldehyde; biofuel; catalysis; catalyst; ester; methanol; oxidation; performance assessment; physicochemical property; sulfide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081068990

This strategy gives the possibility to obtain small ZnO nanoparticles loaded on the HNT surface without the use of inorganic salts which envisage the removal of undesired anions and therefore a calcination process at high temperature. It was found that the presence of halloysite improved the UV–vis spectral absorption ability of ZnO. The hybrid was successful used as photocatalyst for the methylorange and rhodamine B degradation. In addition, after eight consecutive cycles for the methylorange photodegradation, the hybrid did not exhibit significant reduction in its photocatalytic performances confirming its stability. Based on trapping experiments and calculated energy bands we also proposed a photocatalytic mechanism. Furthermore, to evaluate the versatility of the synthetized HNT@ZnO hybrid, we used it as catalyst for biodiesel production from soybean oil, too.

In this study, TMO supported on zeolite Y catalysts (Ni-, Cu-, Co-, Zn- and Mn-Y) are prepared via wet-impregnation for deoxygenation of triolein, a model compound of non-edible oil under H2-free condition. The deoxygenation activity of TMO supported on zeolite Y is following the order of Ni-Y &gt; Co-Y &gt; Cu-Y &gt; Mn-Y &gt; Zn-Y.

Besides, the selectivity toward diesel range hydrocarbon is 92.61 %. The superior deoxygenation activity of Ni-Y can be related to synergistic effect between the reduced B/L and high hydrogenolysis ability of Ni that promote the decarboxylation reaction, suppress the cracking and polymerization of heavy hydrocarbon. Therefore, Ni-Y is a potential catalyst to obtain high quality green diesel from non-edible oil through catalytic deoxygenation without addition of external H2 source. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Deoxygenation; Green diesel; Transition metal oxide; Triolein; Zeolite Y","Binary alloys; Biodiesel; Carboxylation; Catalysts; Cobalt alloys; Diesel engines; Hydrocarbons; Manganese alloys; Nickel oxide; Precious metals; Transition metal oxides; Zeolites; Decarboxylation reactions; Deoxygenations; Green diesels; Heavy hydrocarbons; Metal-based catalysts; Synergistic effect; Triolein; Zeolite-Y; Nickel silver",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080081775

High yield of biodiesel, 98.6%, was obtained with a molar rapeseed oil/methyl acetate/methanol ratio of 1:1:8 under 65 °C at 2 h, which is greatly shorter than 6 h over commercial calcium oxide (CaO).

In this context, two different acid-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) i.e. alkylsulfonic acid (Fe3O4-MNPs@Si@AS) and butylcarboxylic acid (Fe3O4-MNPs@Si@BCOOH) were synthesized and evaluated for their efficacy at different concentration in the pretreatment of sugarcane bagasse. It was observed that both of these acid-functionalized MNPs showed concentration-dependent promising catalytic activity as compared to conventional acid pretreatment. Both Fe3O4-MNPs@Si@AS and Fe3O4-MNPs@Si@BCOOH at 500 mg/g of bagasse showed the maximum amount of sugar (xylose) liberated i.e. 18.83 g/L and 18.67 g/L, respectively which are comparatively higher than the normal acid pretreatment (15.40 g/L) and untreated sample (0.28 g/L). Further, both the acid-functionalized MNPs used were recovered by applying magnetic field and reused for next two subsequent cycles of pretreatment. Therefore, such nanotechnology-based approaches can be used as a rapid and eco-friendly alternative method for the pretreatment of a variety of lignocellulosic materials. Moreover, the reuse of the same MNPs for more than one cycle of pretreatment can also help to reduce the cost involved in the process. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Acid functionalized magnetic nanoparticles; Lignocellulosic biomass; Magnetic nanoparticles; Pretreatment; Sugarcane bagasse","Bagasse; Biomass; Catalyst activity; Iron oxides; Magnetite; Nanoparticles; Synthesis (chemical); Acid-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles; Lignocellulosic biomass; Magnetic nano-particles; Pre-Treatment; Sugar-cane bagasse; Nanomagnetics; acid activation; biofuel; biotechnology; cellulose; crop residue; lignin; magnetic field; nanoparticle; recovery method; sugar cane",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076226376

Hierarchy of PC/MWCNTs with micro-, meso-, and macropores provides improved immobilization of electroactive enzymes, aids the facile transportations of electrolyte and increases the conductivity and specific surface areas of anode and results in a much higher catalytic current density for NADH (1.17 mA cm−2 for 10 mM NADH, pH 9.0) and alcohol bioanode (maximum steady-state current density, 0.25 ± 0.03 mA cm−2, pH 8.0) than its singular component analogues (PC and MWCNTs).

However, low mass and heat transfer between a solid catalyst and the cellulose particles severely hampers the efficiency of cellulose conversion. In effort to conquer the obstacle, a series of N-doped mesoporous carbon materials (MCNs) were prepared and employed to catalyze cellulose to HMF by use of the temperature-responsive HCl-releasing effect of MCNs. In this way, acid-base dual catalytic environments can be constructed for efficient conversion of cellulose to HMF. MCN-2-DH⋅nHCl is capable of adsorbing chemically 1.07 mmol HCl/g at room temperature and releasing about 1.01 mmol HCl/g when being heated to 220 °C. It is found that MCN-2-DH⋅nHCl is an excellent catalyst for cellulose conversion, yielding 52.6% HMF, 27.6% reducing sugars and 4.1% levulinic acid with a cellulose conversion of 96.4% after reacting at 220 °C for 80 min. A total carbon yield of 84.3% can be achieved.

In particular, the second-generation biodiesel by selective deoxygenation possesses a higher cetane number, lower cloud point, and higher oxidation stability compared to the fatty acid ester-based biodiesel, and therefore, can be fed directly to the current diesel engines. In present work, we address the significant concerns of cost-effectiveness, high hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) selectivity, modest hydrogen environments, and solvent-free condition using high surface area silica-alumina-supported cobalt oxide nanoparticles as a catalyst to produce fuel-grade hydrocarbons from fatty acid-based feeds that are palm oil and jatropha oil. The catalytic performance is tested for methyl stearate to achieve the best conversion efficiency with remarkable deoxygenation selectivity. The HDO selectivity was as high as 87% at 250 °C and 30 bar H2 pressure, whereas moderate HDO selectivity with relatively higher cracking was observed at 300 °C and 2 bar H2 pressure. Remarkably, the HDO selectivity was comparable in the absence of solvent. The catalyst is recyclable with low metal leaching during the deoxygenation. The use of non-noble metal catalysts under solvent-free conditions offers facile production of fuel-grade hydrocarbons. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biofuel; Cobalt; Deoxygenation; Hydrocarbons; Renewable carbon energy","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Biodiesel; Biofuels; Cobalt; Cobalt compounds; Cost effectiveness; Fatty acids; Hydrocarbons; Hydrogen fuels; Nanocatalysts; Palm oil; Precious metals; Silica; Solvents; Carbon energy; Catalytic performance; Cobalt oxide nanoparticles; Deoxygenations; Non-noble metal catalysts; Oxidation stability; Second-generation biodiesels; Solvent free conditions; Catalyst selectivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078102038

Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) technology is an effective method to convert wet algae to bio-crudes directly. In this study, the HTL processes of two low-lipid content algae, Nannochloropsis sp. and Sargassum sp., were investigated under various reaction temperatures (260–320 °C). Results showed that the bio-crudes yield of Nannochloropsis sp. (39.05 wt% to 54.11 wt%) was significantly higher than that of Sargassum sp. (3.11 wt% to 9.49 wt%). The higher heating value of Nannochloropsis sp. (35.92 MJ/kg to 37.88 MJ/kg) were also slightly higher than that of Sargassum sp., (33.63 MJ/kg to 35.23 MJ/kg). GC–MS analyses showed that Nannochloropsis sp. bio-crude mainly contained amides and N-heterocyclic compounds while Sargassum sp. bio-crude mainly contained N-heterocyclic compounds and ketones. Alcohols were the major aqueous phase compounds for both algae. For Nannochloropsis sp., glycerin accounted for the largest proportion in alcohols, while dianhydromannitol and 1,5-anhydro-D-mannitol were the major alcohols component for Sargassum sp. Based on the compositions of the HTL products and the feedstock, a reaction pathway network of the HTL process of low-lipid algae was proposed in this study. Amino acids related interactions like acylation and Maillard reaction were prominent in HTL process of these two algae, which effectively converted protein and carbohydrate compounds into bio-crudes. © 2019","Bio-crudes; Hydrothermal liquefaction; Low-lipid algae; Reaction network","Amides; Calorific value; Feedstocks; Ketones; Liquefaction; Bio-crudes; Higher heating value; Hydrothermal liquefactions; N-heterocyclic compounds; Nannochloropsis sp; Reaction network; Reaction pathways; Reaction temperature; Algae; 1,5 anhydro dextro mannitol; alcohol; amide; dianhydromannitol; fuel; glycerol; ketone; n heterocyclic compound; unclassified drug; biofuel; lipid; water; alga; biofuel; biotechnology; chemical composition; chemical reaction; lipid; liquefaction; temperature effect; acylation; aqueous solution; Article; biomass conversion; carbohydrate synthesis; chemical composition; controlled study; energy yield; glycation; heating; hydrothermal vent; lipid level; liquefaction; Nannochloropsis; nonhuman; priority journal; reaction analysis; Sargassum; temperature; biomass; microalga; temperature; algae; Nannochloropsis sp.; Sargassum sp.; Biofuels; Biomass; Lipids; Microalgae; Sargassum; Temperature; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078932721

A two-step esterification-transesterification method was used for the HOME production. For the esterification, the crude HSO was pretreated with H2SO4 to reduce its very high acid value to an acceptable level prior to transesterification to biodiesel. Characterization of the calcined cocoa pod husk-plantain peel ash (CCPA) showed that K (50.95%), Mg (2.49%) and Ca (2.30%) were the major metals present, thereby confirming its heterogeneity. Physisorption isotherms obtained for the CCPA indicate it is composed of nanoparticles that are mesoporous in nature.

Upon incorporating Cu or Ni into CoOx, the catalytic performance could be easily boosted. By varying Cu/Ni ratio, reduction temperature as well as catalyst loading, the optimized Cu1Ni1/CoOx exhibited &gt;99% conversion and 91.3% n-heptadecane yield at 240 °C in 8 h. Characterizations showed that synergistic effect between Cu, Ni and CoOx was existed, thus strengthening H2 production ability towards isopropanol and favoring the generation of n-heptadecane. Kinetic studies revealed HDO of oleic acid to alkane mainly proceeded via decarbonylation of stearaldehyde rather than direct decarboxylation of stearic acid, and the rate determining step relied on octadecanol dehydrogenation. This catalyst could be magnetically separated for 5 times recycling and was versatile for in situ HDO of various fatty acids, thus achieving a low-cost, energy-saving biomass-to-biofuel conversion. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass-derived fatty acids; Decarbonylation; In situ hydrodeoxygenation; Isopropanol dehydrogenation; Non-noble metals","Biomass; Carboxylation; Catalysts; Copper compounds; Dehydrogenation; Energy conservation; Hydrogen production; Nickel; Oleic acid; Paraffins; Precipitation (chemical); Catalytic performance; Coprecipitation method; Decarbonylations; Hydrodeoxygenation; Isopropanol dehydrogenation; Rate determining step; Reduction temperatures; Synergistic effect; Cobalt compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076857415

Biodiesel plays a significant role in the carbon sequestration process during cultivation. Scenedesmus algal species was isolated and cultured in a bold basal medium by using nonheat releasing white florescence (2500 lx) for a 12:12-h dark and light cycle. Algae oil was extracted from dried microalgae biomass through a microwave digester–assisted solvent extraction method. Consequently, about 20.8% algal oil per gram was obtained. A waste-based calcium oxide (CaO) nano-catalyst prepared from goat bone was used in the transesterification process. The catalyst was calcinated at 900 °C and characterized using FTIR, SEM, EDX, and XRD techniques. The results revealed a mean particle size of 43.96 nm with an irregular shape, porous structure, and possession of many active sites. The optimized transesterification process offers an optimum biodiesel yield of 92% at the experimental conditions, i.e., at a reaction temperature of 60 °C, 2% (Wt.) catalyst loading and 11:1 methanol to algal oil molar ratio, 1500 rpm stirring speed, and 3 h reaction duration. The physicochemical properties of the produced biodiesel were tested according to ASTM D6751 standards and are in good agreement. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Biodiesel; Microwave digester; Nano-catalyst; Scenedesmus algal species and transesterification; Waste goat bone","Algae; Lime; Microorganisms; Molar ratio; Nanocatalysts; Particle size; Physicochemical properties; Solvent extraction; Transesterification; Algal species; Carbon sequestration; Experimental conditions; Liquid-fuel production; Microwave digester; Nano-catalyst; Solvent extraction methods; Transesterification process; Biodiesel; alga oil; biodiesel; biofuel; calcium oxide; gasoline; methanol; oil; unclassified drug; biofuel; carbon; nanoparticle; solvent; vegetable oil; Article; biomass; bone; controlled study; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; goat; microwave assisted extraction; nanocatalyst; nonhuman; particle size; physical chemistry; reaction temperature; scanning electron microscopy; Scenedesmus; solvent extraction; transesterification; X ray diffraction; animal; catalysis; chemistry; esterification; infrared spectroscopy; metabolism; microalga; microwave radiation; nanotechnology; Scenedesmus; Animals; Biofuels; Biomass; Bone and Bones; Carbon; Catalysis; Esterification; Goats; Microalgae; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Microwaves; Nanoparticles; Nanotechnology; Particle Size; Plant Oils; Scenedesmus; Solvents; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared; X-Ray Diffraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075183888

The use of lipases in biodiesel production is often found as a cost-limiting step, as the operational expenditures in recovering such catalysts may lead to unfeasible market expectations. Herein, magnetic-polymer composites were evaluated as supports to immobilize commercial lipase, following the application in ethyl ester syntheses. A matrix of polysiloxane-polyvinyl alcohol (SiO2-PVA) was selected as the polymeric structure, following Fe3O4 and γFe2O3 coating and incorporation assays to the support backbone. Characterization of the produced catalyst support materials was performed via analysis of X-ray powder diffraction, pore size, Scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and vibrating sample magnetometry. Burkholderia cepacia was then immobilized on the matrices, following transesterification of coconut oil with ethanol. The biodiesel samples generated were all within commercial standards, achieving conversion ester contents higher than 96.5%. The purified product samples (biodiesel) were essentially odorless and translucent appearance.

An ANN model based on standard back-propagation learning algorithm for the engine was developed. Multi-layer perception network (MLP) was used for a non-linear mapping between the input and target parameters. The input or independent parameters were fuel blend, engine speed, fuel density, fuel viscosity, LHV, intake manifold pressure, fuel consumption, exhaust gas temperature, oxygen contained in exhaust gases, oil temperature, relative humidity, and ambient air pressure. Whereas, the target parameters separately were engine power, torque, emissions of CO, CO2, UHC, NO, RMS and Kurtosis of engine's vibration. The results for optimum ANN model showed, the training algorithm of back-propagation with 25-25 neurons in hidden layers (logsig-logsig) is able to predict different parameters of engine for different conditions.

Production of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) as a type of biodiesel was carried out from Chlorella vulgaris bio-oil. Biodiesel was produced in the presence of nano-biocatalysts composed of immobilized lipase on functionalized superparamagnetic few-layer graphene oxide via a transesterification reaction. A hybrid of few-layer graphene oxide and Fe3O4 (MGO) was prepared and characterized. The MGO was functionalized with 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane (MGO-AP) as well as with a couple of AP and glutaraldehyde (MGO-AP-GA). The Rhizopus oryzae lipase (ROL) was immobilized on MGO and MGO-AP using electrostatic interactions as well as on MGO-AP-GA using covalent bonding. The supports, MGO, MGO-AP, and MGO-AP-GA, as well as nano-biocatalyst, ROL/MGO, ROL/MGO-AP, and ROL/MGO-AP-GA, were characterized using FESEM, VSM, FTIR, and XRD. The few-layer graphene oxide was characterized using AFM and the surface charge of supports was evaluated with the zeta potential technique. The nano-biocatalysts assay was performed with an evaluation of kinetic parameters, loading capacity, relative activity, time-course thermal stability, and storage stability. Biodiesel production was carried out in the presence of nano-biocatalysts and their reusability was evaluated in 5 cycles of transesterification reaction. Results: The AFM analysis confirmed the few-layer structure of graphene oxide and VSM also confirmed that all supports were superparamagnetic. The maximum loading of ROL (70.2%) was related to MGO-AP-GA. The highest biodiesel conversion of 71.19% achieved in the presence of ROL/MGO-AP-GA. Furthermore, this nano-biocatalyst could maintain 58.77% of its catalytic performance after 5 cycles of the transesterification reaction and was the best catalyst in the case of reusability. Conclusions: In this study, the synthesized nano-biocatalyst based on bare and functionalized magnetic graphene oxide was applied and optimized in the process of converting microalgae bio-oil to biodiesel for the first time and compared with bare lipase immobilized on magnetic nanoparticles. Results showed that the loading capacity, kinetic parameters, thermal stability, and storage stability improved by the functionalization of MGO. The biocatalysts, which were prepared via covalent bonding immobilization of enzyme generally, showed better characteristics. © 2020 The Author(s).","Bio-oil; Biodiesel; Chlorella vulgaris; Few-layer graphene oxide; Nano-biocatalyst; Superparamagnetic","Algae; Biodiesel; Enzyme immobilization; Fatty acids; Graphene; Iron oxides; Kinetic parameters; Magnetic nanoparticles; Magnetite; Microorganisms; Reusability; Stability; Superparamagnetism; Synthesis (chemical); Synthetic fuels; Thermodynamic stability; Transesterification; Bio oil; Catalytic performance; Chlorella vulgaris; Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs); Few-layer graphene; Rhizopus oryzae lipase; Superparamagnetics; Transesterification reaction; Biocatalysts; biofuel; catalyst; experimental study; laboratory method; nanoparticle; Chlorella vulgaris; Rhizopus oryzae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082528307

For the first time, to enhance the catalytic activity of Ni particles, a coating technique producing a nanostructured surface was used, maintaining anyway the micrometric dimension of the catalyst, necessary for an easier recovery. The optimum conditions for non-catalytic liquefaction tests were determined to be 330 °C and 10 min with the bio-crude yield of 32.88%. The addition of metallic Ni catalysts (Commercial Ni powder and nanostructured surface-modified Ni particle) increased the oil yield and inhibited the char formation through hydrogenation action. Nano modified Ni catalyst resulted in a better catalytic activity in terms of bio-crude yield (36.63%), thanks to the higher surface area due to the presence of flower-like superficial nanostructures.

In this work, aqueous phase recirculation was conducted in the ethanol-water solvent to evaluate the feasibility of ethanol addition in inhabiting the re-polymerization of nitrogenous compounds. The present study provides a comprehensive comparison of yield and quality between bio-oils derived from aqueous phase recirculation in the water solvent and ethanol-water solvent. The results showed that the addition of ethanol in aqueous phase recirculation displayed higher promotion in bio-oil yield (7%) compared with water solvent (3.55%). The energy recovery efficiency of bio-oil from ethanol-water solvent reached 87.43% after recirculation for three times, while that from the water solvent was 74.61%. The elemental analysis and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis indicated that ethanol addition could inhibit the re-polymerization of nitrogenous compounds and thus decrease the nitrogen content in bio-oil. This resulted in lower NO and HCN emission peaks during the combustion process. Besides, the addition of ethanol increased the content of light molecular weight fractions and decreased the coke formation, which contributed to complete combustion and resulted in lower CO emission peaks. Overall, this work provides a feasible way for further improving the bio-oil yield and fuel quality through ethanol addition in solvent during aqueous phase recirculation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Aqueous phase recirculation; Bio-oil; Ethanol–water solvent; Microalgae; Water solvent","Combustion; Ethanol; Gas chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Nitrogen; Polymerization; Bio oil; Comprehensive comparisons; Energy recovery efficiency; Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; Micro-algae; Molecular weight fraction; Recirculations; Water solvents; Organic solvents; aqueous solution; biofuel; combustion; ethanol; microalga; nitrogen compound; oil; solvent",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078960984

The AC was synthesized from coconut fibre residues (CFR), where CFR is the by-product from coconut milk extraction and is particularly rich in soft fibres with high mineral content. The Niy-Agx/AC catalyst afforded higher DO activity via the decarboxylation/decarbonylation (deCOx) route than Agx/AC due to the properties of Ni, synergistic interaction of Ni and Ag species, adequate amount of strong acid sites and large number of weak acid sites, which cause extensive C-O cleavage and lead to rich formation of n-(C15+C17) hydrocarbons. The effect of Ag and Ni content were studied within the 5 to 15 wt% range. An optimum Ni and Ag metal content (5 wt%) for deCOx reaction was observed. Excess Ni is not preferable due to a tendency for cracking and Ag-rich containing catalyst weakly enforced triglycerides breaking. The Ni5-Ag5/AC govern exclusively decarbonylation reaction, which corroborates the presence of Ni2+ species and a high amount of strong acid sites. Ultimately, Ni5-Ag5/AC in the present study shows excellent chemical stability with consistent five reusability without drastic reduction of hydrocarbon yield (78–95%) and n-(C15+C17) selectivity (82–83%), which indicate favourable application in JCO DO. © 2019","Ag2O; Carbon; Decarboxylation/decarbonylation; Deoxygenation; NiO","Activated carbon; Biofuels; Carbon; Carboxylation; Catalyst activity; Catalytic cracking; Chemical stability; Diesel engines; Hydrocarbons; Nickel oxide; Reusability; Silver; Silver oxides; Activated carbon catalysts; Ag2O; Coconut residues; Decarboxylation/decarbonylation; Deoxygenations; Hydrocarbon yield; Jatropha Curcas oil; Synergistic interaction; Nickel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075869354

Undertaken in Europe and in the world initiatives in limiting the use of coal tend to use bioalcohols as fuels and predict an increase of usage of this type of fuel. The article presents production technologies of selected alcohol mixtures. Raw materials, particular stages of production were characterized in the article. In addition, the possibility of using waste raw materials containing a lignocellulose complex for the production of ethyl alcohol was also presented. The structure of the lignocellulose complex, production stages and main problems of the ethanol production process from this type of raw materials were described. Attention was drawn to the ongoing research for methods to produce ethyl alcohol in chemical reactions (e.g. by using nanocatalysts), in which greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide) are the substrate. An analysis of regulations and legal restrictions that may affect the possibility of using alcohol distillates (bioethanol, spirit, ethyl alcohol, methyl alcohol and mixtures thereof) for heating purposes was carried out. Since Poland is a member state of the European Union, the analysis considered national and EU regulations. In addition, ways of using alcohol distillates (ethyl alcohol, spirit, bioethanol) as a component for fuel mixtures or spontaneous fuel were presented. The combustion process of selected alcoholic distillates, with or without contaminants, was characterized. Emission factor for different emissions in the household sector depending on burned fuel were presented. Two groups of household appliances powered with alcohol fuel, currently available to consumers on the market, were distinguished. Their possibilities and limitations of use, functionality were described. In conclusions, the results of the analyses methods of alcoholic distillate production and legal provisions (national and EU) were summarized. In addition, the authors predict the positive impact of the production and usage of ethyl alcohol for heating purposes. © 2020, Oil and Gas Institute – National Research Institute.

Particularly, a magnetic multifunctional solid acid catalyst (Fe3O4/Cl–MCMB–SO3H) was synthesized by loading the active groups on the magnetic mesocarbon microbead (MCMB) derived from the co-calcination of coal tar pitch and ferroferric oxide, which was applied as a catalyst in the conversion of cellulose into TRS. RESULTS: Given the superior properties of MCMB, a novel magnetic MCMB-based solid acid with cellulose-binding domain (–Cl group) and catalytic domain (–SO3H group) was successfully prepared. Results indicated that this catalyst exhibited superior catalytic activity, recyclability and regenerability, and easy separation from the reactant. The acidic densities of –SO3H and –Cl in Fe3O4/Cl–MCMB–SO3H reached 1.77 and 1.32 mmol/g, respectively. The 68.6% TRS yield can be obtained from cellulose at 140 °C for 3 h in distilled water by using Fe3O4/Cl-MCMB-SO3H as the catalyst. The TRS yield still reached 61.1% after the catalyst was used six times. Importantly, through catalyst regeneration, the –SO3H density and TRS yield still reached 1.69 mmol/g and 67.3%, indicating that the catalyst exhibited excellent regenerability.

Here we report on the synthesis of rice husk silica (RHS) and mesoporous templated rice husk silica (MT-RHS) using sodium silicate, obtained from rice husk ash, and castor oil as a pore directing agent. The resulting silicas were functionalized with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTS) or 3-diethylaminopropyltrimethoxysilane (DEPA), and their catalytic activity evaluated in the transesterification of model C4–C12 triglycerides (TAG) to their corresponding fatty acid methyl esters, of relevance to biodiesel synthesis. Castor oil templating enhances the surface area of rice husk silica, and introduces uniform 4 nm mesopores, albeit as a disordered pore network. Post-synthetic grafting of silica by APTS or DEPA resulted in base site loadings of 0.5 and 0.8 mmolg−1 respectively on RHS and MT-RHS. Turnover frequencies of amine-functionalized MT-RHS were 45–65% greater than those of their amine-functionalized RHS counterparts for tributyrin transesterification. Switching from a primary (APTS) to tertiary (DEPA) amine increased activity three-fold, delivering 80% tributyrin conversion to methyl butyrate in 6 h. DEPA-MT-RHS was effective for the transesterification of C8 and C12 triglycerides, with methyl caproate and methyl laurate selectivities of 93% and 71% respectively in 24 h. © 2019","Biodiesel; Catalysis; Organic-inorganic hybrids; Rice husk silica; Sol-gel synthesis; Solid base; Templated silica","Biodiesel; Catalysis; Catalyst activity; Fatty acids; organic-inorganic materials; Porous materials; Silicates; Sodium compounds; Sol-gels; Synthetic fuels; Transesterification; Vegetable oils; Organic-inorganic hybrid; Rice husk silica; Sol - Gel synthesis; Solid base; Templated; Silica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075396488

This raw material was investigated as an innovative and non-conventional alternative for biodiesel production. S. cearensis appears in this article as an energy source with valuable sustainable factors, allowing for financial savings and low environmental impact compared to fossil fuels. Influences of ultrasonic energy on different process variable were elucidated. An experimental design was applied, employing 4 main factors (type and proportion of catalyst, the proportion of methanol and reaction time) to evaluate the effect of the process variables and determine the optimal conditions for biodiesel production. The present study revealed two main factors interactions, ratio, and type of catalyst, which had significant effects on the ultrasonic-assisted in situ transesterification based on statistical evaluation. The results indicated as optimal conditions: basic catalyst (KOH), 5 wt % catalyst, 1:6 methanol: oil (molar ratio) and reaction time of 30 (min). Besides, a kinetic study exposed that the ultrasonic assistance in situ transesterification reaction complies properly with first-order kinetics and activation energy of 27.53 kJ.mol-1. Yields of up to 99.99% conversion to biodiesel were achieved in the present study.

Therefore, the AC/CuFe2O4@CaO was used as an efficient and novel nanocatalyst to produce biodiesel from chicken fat. In order to determine the physical characteristics of the AC/CuFe2O4@CaO nanocatalyst, a number of analyses were performed, including Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Energy Dispersive X-Ray (EDX), X-Ray Diffractometer (XRD), Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR) and Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) analyses.

This work aimed at elucidating how the lignin structures recovered from various agricultural and industrial residues governed the downstream catalytic conversion. Three types of lignins, namely bio-enzymatic lignin (BL), organosolv lignin (OL), and Kraft lignin (KL), were fully characterized by HSQC-NMR, TGA, FTIR, and SEM to obtain a detailed description of their structures. In consideration of redox-active CuO and highly active carbon-modified boron nitride (BCN) in oxidative dehydrogenation, a two-dimensional CuO/BCN catalyst was prepared and explored in microwave-assisted lignin conversion to improve the yields of aromatic monomers. BL achieved the highest yield of monomers (10 wt%) over the CuO/BCN catalyst after the 3rd cycle in 30 min under mild conditions (200 °C). The yields of bio-oils reached 70 wt% in 10 min when BL and OL were used as the substrate. High efficiency of the microwave-assisted reaction was illustrated by comparing with that of the hydrothermal reaction. This work demonstrated strong dependence of the conversion efficiency on the interunit linkages and functional groups of lignin structures. The strong metal-support interaction between CuO and BCN not only facilitated lignin depolymerization via the promoted electron transfer, but also enhanced the stability of Cu catalysts under hydrothermal conditions.

Here, hydrosilane-mediated hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of the furanic mixture 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and 5-chloromethylfurfural (CMF), directly derived from cellulosic biomass, can be enabled by heterogeneous Pd-catalyzed dechlorination to exclusively give the biofuel 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) in a high overall yield of 72%. Kinetic and isotope labeling studies supported by computational calculations explicitly elucidate the reaction pathways. The initial dechlorination of CMF into acidic species promotes the rapid in situ formation of relatively stable acetalized and etherified furanic intermediates, which not only greatly accelerate the reactivity of the entire HDO process (TOF: up to 1200 h-1), but are also able to significantly get rid of unwanted side reactions. Importantly, this catalytic system can also be applied for the upgrade of various chlorinated carboxides to produce ortho-, meta- and para-substituted arenes with satisfactory yields of 82-99% at 25-45 °C, and the used commercial Pd/C catalyst is highly recyclable.

Sulfur-selenium co-doped graphene/gold nanoparticles (S–Se-GR/AuNPs) is synthesized and used as supporting substrate of biocathode and bioanode. The glucose oxidase (GOD) molecules are bonded to carboxyl-functionalized AuNPs through the condensation reaction between the amino groups in enzyme and carboxyl groups on the AuNPs to form the bioanode. The ultra-thin porous carbon shell/AuNPs-complementary strand of cDNA (UPCS/AuNPs-cDNA) is meticulously designed. The potassium ferricyanides are then inserted in mesoporous UPCS/AuNPs as the biocathode electron acceptor, and the cruciform DNA bioconjugate is synthesized as signal amplifier. When target miRNA is added, the hybridization reaction happens between miRNA and capture probe DNA on the biocathode to open the capture probe DNA chain. Cruciform DNA bioconjugate is immobilized onto the biocathode through base pairing with the capture DNA on the biocathode, which can release electron acceptor [Fe(CN)6]3-, resulting in the dramatically increase of the open circuit voltage of the EBFCs. The self-powered biosensor responds linearly in the miRNA level range of 0.5–10000 fM with a detection limit of 1.5 × 10−16 mol L−1.

The Me–MgAl characterization revealed that the materials present different crystalline structures and the metal addition caused surface area reduction and increased the apparent crystallite size. On the other hand, the addition of the base metals to hydrotalcite deeply affected the base properties of the oxides, increasing their catalytic activity. Particularly, the Ba–MgAl presents the highest amount of strong base sites which resulted in a high conversion (≈90%) in the model transesterification reaction between methyl acetate and ethanol.

Lignocellulosic biomass, consisting of inedible plant material, has emerged as a potential alternative for the production of biofuels, biochemicals, and nanocellulose-based advanced materials. The lignocellulosic biomass, which consists mainly of carbohydrate-based polysaccharides (hemicellulose and cellulose), is a green intermediate for the synthesis of bio-based products. In recent years, the re-engineering of biomass into a variety of commodity chemicals and liquid fuels by using Lewis acid catalysts has attracted much attention. Much research has been focused on developing new chemical strategies for the valorization of different biomass components. Homogeneous Lewis acid catalysts seem to be one of the most promising catalysts due to their astonishing features such as being less corrosive to equipment and being friendlier to the environment, as well as having the ability to disrupt the bonding system effectively and having high selectivity.

The transport of this feedstock over long distance has been proven to be a major burden on the commercialisation of biorefining. Therefore, it has been generally accepted that biomass should be upgraded to biocrude (a relatively high energy density liquid) in close proximity to the biomass sources. The biocrude liquid would then be transported to a biorefinery. Biocrude contains large amounts of oxygen (generally up to 38 wt%) that is removed from the crude in the refining process. In this study, we have synthesised a range of spinel oxide based catalysts to remove oxygen from the biocrude during the catalytic fast pyrolysis. The activity of spinel oxide (MgB2O4 where B = Fe, Al, Cr, Ga, La, Y, In) catalysts were screened for the pyrolysis reaction. While all the tested spinel oxides deoxygenated the pyrolysis vapour, MgCr2O4 was found to be effective in terms of oxygen removal efficiency relative to the quantity of bio oil produced. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural waste; Biomass; Deoxygenation; Pyrolysis; Spinel oxides","Agricultural wastes; Aluminum compounds; Biomass; Catalysts; Chromite; Feedstocks; Oxygen; Pyrolysis; Refining; Close proximity; Commercialisation; Energy density; Fast pyrolysis; High energy densities; Pyrolysis reaction; Refining process; Renewable diesels; Magnesium compounds; aluminum; chromium; gallium; indium; iron; lanthanum; oxide; yttrium; aluminum oxide; biofuel; magnesium oxide; spinell; agricultural emission; biofuel; biomass; catalyst; oxide; solid waste; agricultural waste; Article; catalyst; decomposition; elemental analysis; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; gel permeation chromatography; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; pyrolysis; surface area; temperature; transmission electron microscopy; X ray powder diffraction; biomass; catalysis; Aluminum Oxide; Biofuels; Biomass; Catalysis; Magnesium Oxide; Oxides; Pyrolysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089087675

Biomass derived aliphatic alcohols and diols were also selectively methylated on the β-position, opening a pathway to “biohybrid” molecules constructed entirely from non-fossil carbon.

A lot of focus has been put on renewable energy as the fossil fuel reserve is expected to last only a few decades. Biomass is recognised as a potential source of renewable energy but however, it usually requires further processing before it can be used. In the present study, biochar was prepared via pyrolysis using palm fibre as the biomass feedstock. This paper provides experimental data for the production of biochar at a temperature range of 300 to 900 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C/min. The obtained biochar was characterised using bomb calorimeter, Micromeritics ASAP 2020 Physisorption BET and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX). The biochar gasification behaviour was studied in a Thermogravimetric Analyzer at temperatures ranging from 600 to 1000 °C. From the pyrolysis experiments, it was found that a good char yield can be obtained at lower pyrolysis temperatures. For the gasification experiment, a temperature of 800 °C and above is required for gasification to take place. Energy consumption can be reduced significantly for future research when employ this operating condition. Properties of solid fuel like char reactivity and carbon conversion under well defined gasifying agent and temperature is necessary for designing any gasifier model. It can be concluded that palm fibre can be upgraded into solid biofuel and has potential to be used as a feedstock for renewable energy production. © 2020","Biochar; Biomass; Gasification; Palm fibre; Pyrolysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104472831

The disadvantages of conventional biocatalysts such as catalyst deactivation, mass transfer, poisoning, and long reaction time can be outstripped by novel nanobiocatalysts. Nanobiocatalyst increases the catalytic activity; and this higher activity is because of the increased surface to volume ratio and hence it can act as a deoxygenation catalyst too.

Until now, various technological approaches, as well as oil sources, have been proposed for biodiesel production, but an industrially scalable technology with high end-product quality and production efficiency has not been developed and brought to the market yet. Biodiesel is produced in Europe and North America mainly from rapeseed, or canola, sunflower and soybean oil. However, other underutilized plant species could also be considered as potential oil feedstocks for biodiesel. The great perspective holds Brassicaceae family, especially such species as false flax (Camelina sativa) and Ethiopian mustard (Brassica carinata), but many other Brassicaceae crops are still out of sight. Objectives: This research has been conducted aiming to identify and compare the productivity of several Brassicaceae crops (camelina or false flax (C. sativa), turnip rape (B. campestris), oil radish (Raphanus sativus var. oleifera) and tyfon (B. rapa ssp. oleifera f. biennis × (ssp. rapifera × ssp. pekinensis)), that are suitable for biodiesel production under conditions of temperate climate regions (Northern America, Europe); and to obtain biodiesel by transesterification of fatty acids present on these species using bioethanol. Methods and Materials: Seed oil content, yield and fatty acid profiles have been studied and analysed in different genotypes of C. sativa (10), winter (6) and spring (4) B. campestris, R. sativus var. oleifera (8) and tyfon (5). The most productive crops have been identified: false flax variety ‘Evro-12’ (1620 kg of oil per hectare) and ‘Peremoha’ (1657 kg/ha); winter turnip rape variety ‘Oriana’ (1373 kg/ha), oil radish variety ‘Kyianochka’ (1445 kg/ha) and tyfon varieties ‘Fitopal’ (1730 kg/ha) and ‘Obriy’ (1860 kg/ha). According to chromatographic analysis results, oils of winter turnip rape and tyfon contain high levels (38-42,8%) of erucic (22:1) acid, while oils from spring turnip rape, false flax and oil radish possess high amounts of short-chained fatty acids (not longer than C18) – up to 85,37% in camelina breeding line FEORZhYaFD. Fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) were produced from oil of best genotypes and proved to comply with all main quality requirements for diesel. Results: Moreover, a new solvent-based technology of high-yield (up to 96%) FAEE production, has been firstly proposed for C. sativa oil conversion. Conclusion: Best genotypes that can be used as a plant oil source for biodiesel production have been identified for camelina, turnip rape, oil radish and tyfon species. The data obtained on seed oil content, yield and fatty acid profiles suggested that they are: false flax – breeding form FEORZhYaFD; winter turnip rape-variety ‘Oriana’; oil radish-variety ‘Rayduha’ and tyfon hybrid-variety ‘Fitopal’. Biodiesel samples obtained from these plants fit the Ukrainian standards for diesel fuel and can be used in car engines. The proposed new technological approach to produce fatty acid ethyl esters allows to reduce reaction time and to increase esters yield and quality. © 2020 Blume et al.

Above all, the lack of the petroleum products, the increase in fuel efficiency and affordable by the public are significant reasons for the green diesel to become one of the most important energy supplies for our future The review found important research areas to be reduction in cost of production and maintenance, improvement in fuel quality and improvement in the environmental benefit from using green diesel. With regard to cost reduction, experiments have been conducted on use of low cost catalysts, waste products as feedstocks and H2-free reaction atmosphere. Fuel quality improvement studies have proposed new catalysts, reaction pathways and conditions to improve hydrocarbon selectivity and fuel stability.

To this end, different catalyst supports were employed to load Mo oxides or sulfides through incipient wetness impregnation. The prepared nanocatalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction to determine the formed phases, N2 adsorption/desorption to clarify the surface properties, and SEM to observe the morphology and energy-dispersive X-ray to provide the atomic mapping. A series of nanocatalysts including the Mo sulfide loaded over graphene oxide (MoS2/GrO) or porous graphene (MoS2/graphene), Mo oxide loaded over charcoal, and Co-Mo oxide loaded over MgO were studied in the fast pyrolysis of the bagasse.

It was found that with accordance to the demanded chemicals, the catalysts can be chosen which is highly valuable in producing chemicals and each catalysts support results in a specific set of products. In general, the acetic acid was the main product without using catalyst, and by using the MoS2/GrO nanocatalyst, the phenols were formed dominantly which are of great importance in different industries. This novel work successfully revealed that the metal-based catalysts can be employed instead of the zeolites which paves the way toward using low-cost metallic catalysts in producing bio-chemicals and bio-oils. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Bagasse; Bio-oil; Fast pyrolysis; Graphene; Molybdenum sulfide; Nanocatalyst","Bagasse; Binary alloys; Biofuels; Charcoal; Cobalt compounds; Costs; Graphene; Layered semiconductors; Magnesia; Molybdenum oxide; Morphology; Nanocatalysts; Oxide minerals; Pyrolysis; Sulfur compounds; Zeolites; Catalysts support; Energy dispersive x-ray; Fast pyrolysis; Incipientwetness impregnation; Metal-based catalysts; Metallic catalysts; Porous graphene; Sugar-cane bagasse; Catalyst supports",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091687043

Among biofuels, biodiesel has emerged as the main candidate to substitute petroleum diesel. The present study aimed to identify the maximum yield point of biodiesel production by generating a response surface using molar ratio, temperature and agitation time as independent variables, and yield as a dependent variable. From the response surface, it is observed that the increase in temperature and reaction time leads to reduced yield. The configuration that resulted in maximum yield of 93.30% was 12:1 molar ratio, 30 °C temperature and 30-minute reaction time. From the chromatographic analysis it was possible to identify five different fatty acids in the composition of the biodiesels. Total saturated fatty acids (palmitic and stearic acids) ranged from 41.53% to 42.09% and total unsaturated fatty acids including monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids (oleic, linoleic and linolenic acids) ranged from 57.92% to 58.48%. According to the results of the physicochemical analyses, the specific mass at 68°F is in agreement with Brazilian, American and European specifications, ranging from 877.46 kg m-3 to 879.64 kg m-3. The kinematic viscosity at 104 °F ranged from 4.49 mm² s-1 to 4.82 mm² s-1. The acid value obtained did not vary within the limits established by the norms, and values between 0.54 and 2.74 mg KOH g-1 were observed. © 2020, Eesti Pollumajandusulikool.

The development of efficient and stable heterogeneous catalysts is vital to produce bio-diesel in an efficient and green way. Nanocatalysts provide a high surface-to-volume ratio as well as high active site loading and can improve mass transfer, which is beneficial to enhance their catalytic activity. Objective: The review focuses on the latest advances in the production of biodiesel using nanostruc-tured catalysts. Methods: Biodiesel is mainly produced through esterification and transesterification reaction using acids, bases or lipases as catalysts. We mainly review the synthesis methods and physicochemical properties of various basic, acidic and lipase nanocatalysts. Meanwhile, their catalytic activities in biodiesel production are also discussed. Results: Alkali nanocatalysts are mainly suitable for transformation of oils with low acid values to biodiesel via transesterification reaction. In contrast, acidic nanocatalysts are not sensitive to water as well as free fatty acids and can avoid saponification associated with basic nanocatalysts while pro-mote simultaneous esterification and transesterification reaction. However, acid-catalyzed trans-esterification usually requires harsh reaction conditions. In addition, the lipase-catalyzed process is also suitable for non-edible oils containing high contents of free fatty acids, which possess environmental and economic advantages. Conclusion: Nanocatalysts have many advantages such as good accessibility with nanostructure, high active site loading and reduction of mass transfer resistance. However, most of those materials undergo deactivation after several cycles. Therefore, the development of more efficient, stable, and low-cost nanocatalysts is desirable for producing biodiesel. © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.","Biodiesel production; Esterification; Functional nanocatalysts; Heterogeneous catalysis; Renewable oil; Transesterification","Biodiesel; Catalyst activity; Diesel engines; Esters; Fatty acids; Mass transfer; Physicochemical properties; Polymer blends; Transesterification; Biodiesel production; Economic advantages; Functional Nano materials; Heterogeneous catalyst; High surface-to-volume ratio; Lipase catalyzed process; Mass transfer resistances; Transesterification reaction; Nanocatalysts; biodiesel; calcium oxide; canola oil; fatty acid; lauric acid; magnesium oxide; metal organic framework; nanomaterial; oleic acid; palmitic acid; rapeseed oil; soybean oil; stearic acid; sunflower oil; triacylglycerol lipase; Article; biofuel production; calcination temperature; cost benefit analysis; esterification; magnetic field; nanocatalyst; nanoencapsulation; physical chemistry; priority journal; saponification; sulfonation; surface area; synthesis; transesterification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084267935

Objective: This research aims to develop a carbon-increasing catalytic process through the dimeriza-tion of 5-methylfurfuryl alcohol to produce the C11 oxygenate bis(5-methylfuran-2-yl) methane. Methods: In this work, 5-methylfurfural, derivable from sugars, could be reduced to the expensive 5-methylfurfuryl alcohol over Cs2 CO3 using an eco-friendly hydride polymethylhydrosiloxane. In the subsequent carbon-increasing process, a solid acidic nanocatalyst 3-chlorpyridine phosphotungstic acid (3-ClPYPW) was developed to be efficient for the conversion of 5-methylfurfuryl alcohol to bis(5-methylfuran-2-yl) methane under mild reaction conditions. Results: A good bis(5-methylfuran-2-yl) methane yield of 51.6% was obtained using dichloro-methane as a solvent at a low temperature of 70°C in 11 h. The solid nanocatalyst was able to be reused for at least four cycles without a remarkable loss of catalytic activity. The kinetic study proved that the reaction is a first-order reaction with apparent activation energy (Ea) of 41.10 kJ mol-1, while the thermodynamic study certified that the reaction is non-spontaneous and endother-mic.

The use of DEE is considered taking into account the favorable properties for blending with SVO and fossil diesel, such as its very low kinematic viscosity, high oxygen content, low autoignition temperature, broad flammability limits (it works as a cold start aid for engines), and very low values of cloud and pour point. Therefore, DEE can be used as a solvent of vegetable oils to reduce the viscosity of the blends and to improve cold flow properties. Besides, DEE is considered renewable, since it can be easily obtained from bioethanol, which is produced from biomass through a dehydration process. The vegetable oils evaluated in the mixtures with DEE were castor oil, which is inedible, and sunflower oil, used as a standard reference for waste cooking oil. In order to meet European petrodiesel standard EN 590, a study of the more relevant rheological properties of biofuels obtained from the DEE/vegetable oil double blends has been performed. The incorporation of fossil diesel to these double blends gives rise to diesel/DEE/vegetable oil triple blends, which exhibited suitable rheological properties to be able to operate in conventional diesel engines. These blends have been tested in a conventional diesel engine, operating as an electricity generator. The efficiency, consumption and smoke emissions in the engine have been measured. The results reveal that a substitution of fossil diesel up to 40% by volume can be achieved, independently of the SVO employed. Moreover, a significant reduction in the emission levels of pollutants and better cold flow properties has been also obtained with all blends tested. © 2020 by the authors.","Biofuel; Bosch smoke number; Castor oil; Diesel engine; Diethyl ether; Electricity generator; Smoke opacity; Straight vegetable oils (SVO); Sunflower oil","Bioethanol; Biofuels; Blending; Dehydration; Electric power generation; Ethers; Fossil fuels; Fuel additives; Petroleum additives; Quality control; Rheology; Smoke; Sunflower oil; Thermal processing (foods); Viscosity; Bosch smoke number; Castor oil; Diethyl ethers; Electricity generators; Smoke opacity; Straight vegetable oils (SVO); Diesel engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082933186

However, mass manufacture of FFA from FUR is restrained by strict requirements of reaction conditions and expensive catalysts. In this work, an economical and benign catalytic system, containing an easily prepared and reusable catalyst 5 wt.% KF/ZrO2 and a low-cost hydrogen source polymethylhydrosiloxane (PMHS), was developed to be efficient for the hydrogenation of FUR to high-value FFA under mild conditions. The catalyst reactivity was found to be remarkably influenced by the support acid-base properties and KF loading doge. In the presence of 5 wt.% KF/ZrO2, a high FFA yield of 97% and FUR conversion of 99% could be obtained at 25°C in just 0.5 h, which was superior to those attained with other tested catalysts. The KF/ZrO2 catalyst could be recycled at least five times, with the FFA yield slightly decreasing from 97% to 71%. The spare decrease in FFA yield is possibly attributed to the catalyst pore blocking, as clarified by SEM, BET, XPS, and ICP-MS measurements of the fresh and reused catalysts. © 2020 Zhaozhuo Yu et al.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079387461

Meanwhile, H2-rich syngas production with the H2 yield of 38.87% was obtained at 535 °C for 20 min, and higher reaction temperature presented a positive influence on H2 production during Pteris vittata L. liquefaction. Moreover, the remaining biochar product was analyzed to determine whether it could be used as a direct solid fuel or auxiliary fuel.

The major processing method for bio-oil conversion was designed based on three key parameters, such as temperature, residence time and catalyst concentration. A remarkable enhancement of bio-oil production was observed for 0.20 g of CeO2 catalyzed HTL at 250 °C for 30 min, and around 26% of conversion was achieved which is higher than catalyst-free HTL reaction (16%). The synthetic CeO2 nanostructure was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), brunauer-emmett-teller surface area (BET), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA).

Moreover, date seed oil (DSO) was firstly utilized in the ultrasound-assisted transesterification reaction. DSO was extracted from Zahidi type date (Phoenix dactylifera) and was esterified to reduce its Free Fatty Acid (FFA) content. Biodiesel yield was optimized in both heating methods, so that the yield of 96.4% (containing 93.5% ester) at 60 °C, with 6 M ratio of methanol/oil, 1 wt% of catalyst (NaOH) and at 90 min of reaction time was reported. The ultrasound irradiation did not influence the reaction conditions except reaction time, reduced to 5 min (96.9% yield and 91.9% ester). The ultrasonic irradiation also influenced on the physicochemical properties of DSO biodiesel and improved its combustion in the diesel engine. The analysis results related to the engine and gas emission confirmed that the ultrasound-assisted produced biodiesel has lower density and viscosity, and higher oxygen content facilitating injection of fuel in the engine chamber and its combustion, respectively. Although, B40 (biodiesel blend consisting of 40% biodiesel and 60% net diesel fuel) as a blend of both fuels presented higher CO2 and lower CO and HC in the emissions, the DSO biodiesel produced by ultrasound irradiation presented better specifications (caused about 2-fold improvement in emissions than that of conventional method).

It's expected that rGO with high specific surface area provides superior catalytic performance for MCNS/rGO than MCNS. Also, the synergic effect of Mo, Ni, and Co in the composite accelerates the urea oxidation and enhances the performance of the catalyst. The composites were characterized by field emission electron microscopy, transition electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction spectroscopy. Electrochemical properties of composites were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry. The MCNS/rGO demonstrated superior electrocatalytic performance than the MCNS catalyst. The incorporating of rGO into MCNS creates a high electrochemical surface area for urea electro-oxidation that resulted in a higher current density (18 mA cm−2) than MCNS (3.7 mA cm−2) at the presence of 0.6 M urea and the scan rate of 20 mV s−1. The maximum current density obtained 43 mA cm−2 for MCNS/rGO at the scan rate of 70 mV s−1 in room temperature. Also, single cells based on MCNS and MCNS/rGO supplied a maximum power density of 7.7 mW cm−2 and 21.0 mW cm−2 at room temperature, respectively.

In the present work, biodiesel was produced from university campus restaurants waste frying soybean oil by means of transesterification reaction. The objective of this study was to reduce the energy and reactants consumption and waste generation to achieve a truly green process. For this purpose, a multiobjective optimization using central composite design (CCD) was performed considering three responses: the reaction conversion, the energy consumption and the green chemistry balance. The last two parameters i.e. the energy consumption and the green chemistry balance were considered as responses for the first time, hence an interesting originality. Temperature, KOH catalyst amount and oil to methanol molar ratio were the CCD independent variables. Five green metrics were used to account for the greenness of the reaction, namely: carbon efficiency, atom economy, reaction mass efficiency, stoichiometric factor and environmental factor. The obtained quadratic models for the prediction of the optimum responses fitted reasonably well the experimental data. The results showed a maximum oil conversion of 100%, minimum energy consumption of 2.69 kJ and maximum green chemistry balance of 77.36% at KOH catalyst concentration of 2 wt%, methanol to oil molar ratio of about 4.73 and a minimum temperature of 45 °C.

Developing heterogeneously functional materials is being deemed as a subject of particular interest to scientists in selective catalytic chemistry especially for biomass valorization. In this regard, porous polymers, featuring high surface areas, prominent stabilities, and chemically adjustable moieties, have attracted extensive concerns. In this Review, recent developments on the application of heterogeneously functionalized porous polymeric catalysts of high performance, including acid/base chemosynthetic organic polymers/natural biodegradable biopolymers like chitosan, organic-inorganic hybrid polymeric materials such as functional porous coordination polymers, and porous polymers immobilized with enzymes for effective upgrading of oil feedstocks into biodiesel are summarized. Catalytic protocols using functional polymeric catalysts provide significant benefits for realizing biorefinery procedures because of the following reasons: (i) no polluting reagents, (ii) high activities and selectivities, and (iii) simple and convenient catalyst recycling. Attention has been drawn, in particular, to understanding the role of acidity/basicity, hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, swelling property, and porosity of polymer materials in biodiesel production through transesterification and esterification reactions. In addition, plausible reaction mechanisms are also depicted accordingly, while highlighting the main remaining challenges and future prospects.

There are usually three strategies to enhance the activity of an electrocatalyst system by increasing the number of active sites on the specific electrocatalyst, the intrinsic activity of each active sites and the ability to transfer charges. The utilization of various nanocatalysts with high specific surface areas is the most common way to increase the number of active sites, whereas the intrinsic activity of each active sites is mainly related to the component and crystal structure of catalysts as well as the type of exposed facets, which are partially responsible to the charge conductivity too. In principle, these three strategies are independent and not mutually exclusive, which could be ideally placed together for being comprehensively considered. However, it is still a great challenge to realizingly describe the relation of these three strategies and simultaneously realize the optimization of these three strategies in an electrocatalyst system owing to the limitation of mass and charge transport, which usually leads to a lower practical performance than the theoretical value from increasing active surfaces. Considerable efforts have been devoted to discovering and developing electrocatalysts with different compositions from noble metals, carbon, to transition metals and their hydroxides or oxides and different mesostructures from nanoparticles, nanowires, nanosheets to their three-dimensional superstructures. Among of them, hollow Co3O4 nanomaterials are well-known to be a kind of promising electrocatalyst due to their multiple valence states and unique mesostructures. Especially, hollow multi-shelled structure (HoMs) of Co3O4 nanomaterials possess some advantages over their counterparts with only one shell, such as more active surfaces, better stability, and usually exhibit higher performance. Herein, we present a nonenzymatic glucose biosensor based on hollow multi-shelled Co3O4 dodecahedra, which obtained from the thermal transformation of Co-based metal-organic framework (ZIF-67). Morphology, crystal structure and electrochemical property of hollow multi-shelled Co3O4 dodecahedra were characterized by using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscope, N2 physisorption, cyclic voltammetry, amperometry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Due to the topological arrangement of Co atoms in ZIF-67, the oriented assembly of Co3O4 nanoparticles in hollow dodecahedra leads to a porous shell with more exposure of (111) facets, which allows for the improved molecule-diffusion and charge-transfer properties as well as enhanced catalytical activities for the electro-oxidation of glucose. As a result, multi-shelled hollow Co3O4 hollow dodecahedra gives a high sensitivity of 4075.2 µA mmol/(L cm2) toward glucose at a low concentration level of 0.01-0.338 mmol/L, which is superior over ordered mesoporous Co3O4 with large and small mesopores of 12 and 4.5 nm (3561.1 and 2074.3 µA mmol/(L cm2), respectively). This work demonstrated the potential of hollow multi-shelled Co3O4 dodecahedra as a novel electrocatalyst for advanced nonenzymatic glucose biosensor, which will bring more opportunities for designing and developing other electrocatalysts with higher activities. © 2019, Science Press.

Wastewater treatment with simultaneous bioenergy and biofuel recovery is also one of the added advantage of employing BESs for CO2 fixation. This review focuses on the potential of employing BES-based technologies like microbial carbon capture, plant-microbial fuel cell and microbial electrosynthesis cell for the concomitant production of valuables and CO2 sequestration.

In this study, we developed ZrO2-based bifunctional heterogeneous catalysts for simultaneous esterification and transesterification of microalgae to biodiesel. To avoid the disadvantage of the low surface area of ZrO2, the catalysts were prepared via a surfactant-assisted sol-gel method, followed by hydrothermal treatments. The response surface methodology central composite design was employed to investigate various factors, like the surfactant/Zr molar ratio, pH, aging time, and temperature on the ZrO2 surface area. The data were statistically analyzed to predict the optimal combination of factors, and further experiments were conducted for verification. Bi2O3 was supported on ZrO2 via the incipient wetness impregnation method. The catalysts were characterized by a variety of techniques, which disclosed that the surfactant-assisted ZrO2 nanoparticles possess higher surface area, better acid–base properties, and well-formed pore structures than bare ZrO2. The highest yield of fatty acid methyl esters (73.21%) was achieved using Bi2O3/ZrO2(CTAB), and the catalytic activity of the developed catalysts was linearly correlated with the total densities of the acidic and basic sites. The mechanism of the simultaneous reactions was also discussed. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"biofuel; bismuth; bismuth oxide; nanoparticle; zirconium; zirconium oxide; catalysis; chemistry; esterification; eukaryote; metabolism; microbiology; surface property; temperature; Biofuels; Bismuth; Catalysis; Esterification; Eukaryota; Nanoparticles; Surface Properties; Temperature; Zirconium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074700611

Therefore, synthesis an active and stable catalyst via simple, cost-effective and industrialization method must be proposed. For this purpose, a series of MgO impregnated on MgAlFe mixed metal catalysts with different Al/Fe molar ratio was prepared via solution combustion method for production of biodiesel from sunflower oil. The results of characterization presented that spinel type of MgFe2O4 was successfully synthesized by combustion method. Moreover, present of Al cation into mixture of precursors caused to the combustion reaction transfer from smoldering to flam reaction that is related to lower heat formation of MgAl2O4. This phenomenon prevents the insufficient growth of crystal and particles. Moreover, due to releasing huge amount of gases during combustion reaction, high reaction temperature and well bonding of active phases with the samples containing Al cations, they showed highly porous structure, high surface area, appropriate pore shape and high thermal stability. These advantages clearly increased their activity in the transesterification reaction. According the results, the MgO/MgAl0.4Fe1.6O4 nanocatalyst was selected as optimum sample that converted 93.2% of sunflower oil to biodiesel at the conditions of 110 °C, 12 M ratio of methanol/oil, 3 wt.% of catalyst and 3 h of reaction time.

Subsequently, the effectiveness of the catalyst was analyzed by subjecting it to sonochemical esterification of an industrial low value waste product, palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD).

These value-added products constitute important materials for the sustainable production of biofuels. The ultralevel quantitative detection of feedstock carbonyls on metal surfaces is possible with surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) technique. Considering environmental friendly protocols for activation of molecular oxygen in both valorization methods of biomass, the corresponding SERS detection protocols are rare. Here, for the very first time, RuO2-DNA nanochains aggregate as an efficient catalyst for oxidation/oxidative cleavage of biomass-derived lignin mimics and their subsequent in-situ SERS detection. Notably, both reactions are carried out in aqueous medium. For the controlled oxidation study, veratryl alcohol and cinnamyl alcohol were used as lignin mimics, and the respective carbonyls were detected by the SERS method by activating molecular oxygen. Also, by changing the oxidant from molecular oxygen to peroxide, the respective acids were seen to be formed for veratryl alcohol. We extend this protocol to oxidative cleavage of lignin-derived olefins, and diols, such as cinnamyl alcohol and 1-phenyl-1,2-ethanediol, and corresponding acids were formed and detected by SERS technique.

Homogenous acid catalysts are mainly used in biodiesel production, but they cannot be recovered and demand costly fuel purification as being corrosive. Similarly, enzyme catalysts are expensive in industrial-scale production of biodiesel. However, heterogeneous catalysts simplify the easy separation of product and by-products from the catalyst along with catalyst reusability and reduction of waste. Solid acid and base catalysts offer more advantages due to their non-toxicity, high surface area, reusability, higher stability, and the simplicity of purification. Solid base catalysts yield better activity than solid acid catalysts, however, they cannot esterify large amounts of free fatty acids (FFAs) in non-food feedstocks. The solid acid catalysts have the added advantages of being more tolerant to high amounts of FFAs and being able to simultaneously esterify FFAs and transesterify triglycerides in cheap feedstocks like waste cooking oil. Recently, an array of inorganic, organic and polymeric solid acid and nanomaterial-based catalysts have been developed using cheap feedstocks. However, the issues of low reactivity, small pore sizes, low stabilities, long reaction times, and high reaction temperatures still need to be solved. The developments of producing efficient, cheap, durable, and stable solid acid and nanomaterial-based catalysts have been critically reviewed in this study. Furthermore, the challenges and future perspectives of production of biodiesel and its industry growth have also been discussed. © 2019","Biodiesel; Heterogeneous catalysts; Homogeneous catalysts; Nano-catalysts; Non-food feedstock; Solid acid/base catalysts","acid; base; biodiesel; fatty acid; inorganic compound; metal oxide; nanomaterial; oil; organic compound; polymer; titanium dioxide; triacylglycerol; biofuel; vegetable oil; biofuel; byproduct; catalysis; catalyst; domestic waste; heterogeneity; homogeneity; polymer; purification; reactivation; reduction; separation; vegetable oil; Article; biofuel production; nanocatalyst; pore size; purification; reaction temperature; reaction time; surface area; transesterification; catalysis; esterification; Biofuels; Catalysis; Esterification; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Plant Oils",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071386748

Various biofuels research with the respect of climate change and emission reduction recently intensifies, particularly in biodiesel. In Indonesia, diesel oil currently in use contains 20% of biodiesel. Utilizing waste-based resources such as rendered chicken tallow as the feedstock could be the solution to both energy and environmental challenges. However, chicken tallow contains a significant amount of free fatty acid (FFA) which will obstruct the production yield of biodiesel. In this study, catalyst-free subcritical methanol has been employed to convert waste chicken tallow (WCT) with high FFA into biodiesel. Design of experiment was conducted to study the effect of temperature, time, and the molar ratio of methanol to fats on the purity and recovery of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). Based on the optimization study performed by response surface methodology (RSM), all three independent variables gave a significant effect on the recovery of FAME. From the experimental results, the maximum FAME yield obtained was 98.43 ± 0.22% with the optimum condition as follows: 167°C, 36.8 minutes, and 42.7:1 (methanol/WCT, mol/mol), while the predicted FAME yield obtained using RSM was 97.76%.

In this study, the techno-economic performances of four catalyst technologies were investigated. The catalysts were bulk calcium oxide (CaO), enzyme, nano-calcium oxide, and ionic liquid. The study was mainly based on process simulations designed using Aspen Plus and SuperPro software. The quantity and quality of biodiesel and glycerol, as well as the amount of biodiesel per amount of feedstock, were the parameters to evaluate technical performances. The parameters for economic performances were total investment cost, unit production cost, net present value (NPV), internal return rate (IRR), and return over investment (ROI). Technically, all the studied options provided fuel quality biodiesel and high purity glycerol. However, under the assumed market scenario, the process using bulk CaO catalyst was more economically feasible and tolerable to the change in market values of major inputs and outputs. On the contrary, the enzyme catalyst option was very expensive and economically infeasible for all considered ranges of cost of feedstock and product.

In most cases, they can be substituted by cheaper alternative catalysts formed by transition metal carbides, such as molybdenum carbide (Mo2C). Among the reactions that can be catalyzed by Mo2C, hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) presents a great technological interest, especially in biofuel production. Nonetheless, the selectivity of carbides in HDO reactions of fatty acids is not well understood yet. In the present work, the reaction mechanism of the acrylic acid HDO over Mo2C, a fatty acid model molecule, was studied by density functional theory (DFT), with Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional and periodic boundary conditions. A global mechanism is proposed, divided in four steps, from acrylic acid to propane. In the first reaction step, decomposition by C–OH bond cleavage, with 24 kcal mol− 1 of activation energy, dominates over C=C and C=O hydrogenation. This result is in line with the absence of propanoic acid among the products and the formation of acrolein, as shown in an experimental work previously published. The proposed global mechanism is in fair agreement with the experimental findings. The main product is propane, which has the same number of carbon atoms of the reactant.

However, separation of heterogeneous catalysts from tissues and carcass of microalgae is an important task. For this reason, a magnetic Fe2O3–Al2O3 nanocatalyst promoted by potassium groups was synthesized using a modified impregnation method and was profoundly studied and compared with nanocatalysts without ferric oxide using X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectroscopy analyses. The results revealed that the magnetic nanocatalyst with a core-shell structure had suitable surface area, pore size, and particle size and also had no impurity on its structure. The nanocatalyst was used for biodiesel production from microalgae cultivated in a wastewater medium via in-situ transesterification reaction. The nanocatalyst converted 95.6% of microalgae lipids to esters at optimum conditions of 65 °C, 12 mL g−1 of methanol-to-dry biomass, 4 wt% of magnetic catalyst and 6 h of reaction time. The magnetic K/Fe2O3–Al2O3 core-shell nanocatalyst was reused for several times and presented high stability with less reduction in its activity until six runs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiesel; Heterogeneous catalyst; In-situ transesterification; Magnetic base catalyst; Microalgae; Wastewater","Algae; Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Biodiesel; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Hematite; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Magnetism; Microorganisms; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Pore size; Potassium hydroxide; Scanning electron microscopy; Shells (structures); Transesterification; Wastewater; Barrett-joyner-halenda; Base catalyst; Brunauer emmett tellers; Fourier transform infra reds; Heterogeneous catalyst; Micro-algae; Modified impregnation method; Situ transesterification; Nanocatalysts; algal culture; aluminum oxide; biofuel; biotechnology; catalysis; hydroxide; magnetic field; microalga; nanoparticle; potassium; reduction; separation; wastewater treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070749594

But, high cost of lipases has been found as a main obstacle to commercialize the enzymatic transesterification. In the present study, cross-linked enzyme aggregates of Km12 lipases have been coupled with amino coated magnetite nanoparticles. SEM analysis showed that mCLEAs-lipase (mCLEAs-lip)nanocomposites have spherical structures. The mCLEAs-lip displayed a shift in optimal pH towards the alkaline, whereas optimal temperature was also shift towards low temperature. mCLEAs-lip nanocomposite reserves its total activity up to 6 cycles of enzyme re-using. Furthermore, it reserves 60% of its initial activity more than free enzyme after 24 days of incubation at 4 °C.

The grafting of HPMo onto the Al-MCM-41 materials not only greatly increased the acidity but also enhanced the acid strength, with an optimal HPMo loading amount in the catalyst of 20 wt%.

Herein, we report a win-win strategy to utilize biomass waste to fabricate functional materials and then transform biomass-derived source into valuable products. We developed a one-step strategy using the green solvent CO2 deposition method to spatially confine monometallic Pd and Pt and bimetallic Pd-Pt nanoparticles in a porous carbon fabricated from biomass waste sorghum at a very low temperature of 40-70 °C. The synthesized monometallic Pd and Pt and bimetallic Pd-Pt nanoparticles display superior performance in the selective conversion of biomass-based furfural into fine chemicals, furfuryl alcohol and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol. With only 3 wt % Pd or 3 wt % Pt supported on the synthesized porous carbon, these catalysts are far superior to the commercial 5 wt % Pd or Pt on carbon support, respectively. The turnover number of the as-prepared 3 wt % Pd/C catalyst shows ∼7 times improvement compared with the commercial 5 wt % Pd/C. This study provided a one-step method to precisely confine monometallic Pd and Pt and bimetallic Pd-Pt in the porous channel of the carbon support, offered more catalytic active sites, and presented excellent performance and high stability. The methodology developed in this work is promising for the synthesis of various metallic nanoparticles and valorization of biomass.

It is possible to produce biodiesel from waste/used cooking oils (WCO) that is comparable in quality to that of fresh vegetable oil. Not only does reuse of WCO, which can otherwise harm human health, reduce the burden on the government of treating oily wastewater, disposing of the waste, and maintaining public sewers, it also significantly lowers the production cost of biodiesel. In the process of frying, oil undergoes many reactions, leading to the formation of a number of undesirable compounds, such as polymers, free fatty acids, and many other chemicals. This poses challenges in the transesterification of WCO. This article covers different techniques in the production of biodiesel from WCO.

A conceptual process simulation of a plant using Super Pro software was used to vary the economic scenarios and to evaluate the effects of selected variables such as prices of biodiesel, glycerol, oil, alcohol, catalyst, equipment maintenance, labor, and tax variation. Changing the values of these variables led to large effects on the overall economics of the production process. Oil purchasing cost exerted a larger influence on the economic outcome, with an approximately 73% decrease in net present value (NPV) for a 22% increase in the oil purchasing cost. Under optimum conditions the process would be profitable for oil costs below 590US$ ton−1. Varying the equipment maintenance costs produced a smaller effect, which could allow the amount of cost allocated for routine maintenance activities to be increased to sustain the productivity of the process.

Biofuel stands out among the most tenable keys for this issue. The lemongrass oil is used as a biofuel because of low density and viscosity when compared with diesel. The lemongrass oil is extracted by steam distillation process. In the present investigation, partially stabilized zirconium, due to its higher thermal conductivity, is selected as coating material. The top surface of the piston and the inlet and exhaust valves are coated up to the preferred thickness of 500 μm by the plasma spray technique. The lemongrass emulsion fuel is prepared in the proportion of 94% of lemongrass oil, 5% of water, and 1% of surfactant span 80.

There have been various reports on DMF production from hydrogenation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). However, most reports employed high hydrogen pressure, long reaction times, and reactions under batch conditions. In this study, Cu-Pd bimetallic catalysts incorporated on reduced graphene oxide (RGO) were used for selective hydrogenation of HMF to DMF using 2-propanol as hydrogen donor under continuous flow conditions. Synthesized catalysts were characterized by N2 physisorption, SEM-EDX, XRD, XPS, TEM, and H2-TPR techniques. 10Cu-1Pd/RGO exhibited 96% HMF conversion with 95% DMF yield under optimum reaction conditions with good stability with time on stream. XRD and XPS results pointed to the presence of a palladium-copper alloy, which could enhance both the activity and especially the stability in the conversion of HMF toward DMF. The effect of temperature, pressure, and feed flow rate were also investigated on the catalytic performance. The stability of catalyst was tested for 8 h time on stream, where it was found that the catalyst displayed good stability.

Efficient utilization of modified nanofluid fuels (MNF) is possible only when engine operating, fuel injection parameters are optimized accordingly. In the present research, experimental and statistical analysis is carried out on a commercial diesel engine (3.5 KW) with the aim to determine the optimal doping rate of nanoparticles and engine operating parameters using response surface methodology (RSM) and desirability function approach (DFA). The modified nanofluid (MNF) fuels used are blend of Acacia Concinna biodiesel (40% by vol.) and diesel (60% by vol.) mixed with titanium dioxide (TiO2) metal nanoparticles in different concentrations. Initially, the prepared fuel blends are characterized by SEM, TEM, blend stability (Uv–Vis spectrophotometery and sedimentation analysis) and various other properties. The optimal value, TiO2 doping rate of 150 mg/liter (MNF150), injection timing of 22.5 °CA btdc and 82.37% engine load is found to be the most suitable combination. Under these condition, brake thermal efficiency (BTE), brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), ignition delay (ID), hydrocarbon (HC), smoke emissions are improved by 3.25%, 18.42%,7%, 38%, 20% respectively with slightly higher NOx emissions in comparison to diesel. This is observed with an overall high desirability value of 0.707.

A total of 29 independent batch experiments were considered in this model to carefully observe the effect of operating factors, such as the volume ratio of methanol/oil, catalyst (KOH) weight percent, reaction temperature, and reaction time. The FCCD model predicted that a maximum yield of 99.5% biodiesel would be achieved from flaxseed oil at a reaction temperature of 59 °C, 0.51% catalyst, the reaction time of 33 min, and a molar ratio of methanol to flaxseed oil of 5.9:1. Experimental verification of the predicted yield under the optimum conditions gave a maximum yield of 98 ± 2%, which is in very good agreement with the predicted value of the model. The physicochemical properties of the flaxseed oil-derived biodiesel were compared with those of standard biodiesel to identify and verify the quality of the produced biodiesel. All observed physicochemical parameters of the flaxseed oil-derived biodiesel were closely in agreement with those of standard biodiesel.

The various concentration of potassium impregnated Fe3O4-CeO2 was screened for catalytic conversion of rapeseed oil to triglyceride methyl ester. The 25 wt % potassium impregnated Fe3O4-CeO2 nanocatalyst showed best biodiesel production. Nanocatalyst was characterized by FTIR, XRD, SEM, TEM, BET and Hammett indicator for basicity test. The characterization of biodiesel was performed with GC-MS, 1H and 13C NMR. Moreover, the optimum reaction parameters such as catalyst amount (wt %), oil to methanol ratio, reaction time and reaction temperature for transesterification reaction was analyzed and yield was determined by 1H NMR. The maximum yield of 96.13% was obtained at 4.5 wt % catalyst amount, 1:7 oil to methanol ratio at 65 °C for 120 min. The properties of biodiesel such as acid value and kinematic viscosity were observed as 0.308 mg KOH/g and 4.37 mm2/s respectively. The other fuel parameters such as flash point and density were also determined. The reusability of catalyst was observed and it showed stability up to five cycles without considerable loss of activity.

Different Ca/Al ratios, in the range of 1.5–6 were studied, alongside pure CaO. The catalysts were characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and CO2-Temperature Program Desorption (TPD). The catalytic activity of the materials was studied for the transesterification reaction of cod liver oil with methanol at 65 °C, with 1:12 oil to methanol molar ratio and 10 wt% of catalyst. Over 97% conversion of the triglycerides to methyl esters was achieved for the 6Ca/Al catalyst after 2 h reaction time. This was similar to the performance of CaO. However, 6Ca/Al catalyst was reused successfully for seven consecutive tests, in contrast to CaO that was reused for only five tests, before it deactivated. Therefore, by incorporating the Ca3Al2O6, it was possible to enhance the stability of the catalytically active species and improve the lifetime of the catalyst. Post-test catalyst characterisation showed the formation of an intermediate phase (calcium diglyceroxide) that enhanced the catalyst's performance and tolerance to air exposure and humidity. Finally, the catalyst deactivation, after seven cycles, took place due to the formation of Ca(OH)2 and CaCO3 species. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiesel; Heterogeneous catalyst; Transesterification reaction; Waste fish oil","Biodiesel; Calcite; Calcium carbonate; Catalyst deactivation; Fish; Hydrated lime; Methanol; Molar ratio; Scanning electron microscopy; Synthetic fuels; Transesterification; Biodiesel production; Biodiesel synthesis; Calcium diglyceroxide; Catalytically active species; Fish oil; Heterogeneous catalyst; Solid base catalysts; Transesterification reaction; Catalyst activity; biofuel; biological production; catalysis; catalyst; chemical reaction; oil; performance assessment; solid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062275534

Herein, we report the sequential synthesis of a hybrid nanocatalyst CoxP@POP, where substoichiometric CoxP nanoparticles are distributed in a porous organic polymer (POP) via solid-state phosphidation of the Co3O4@POP nanohybrid system. We also explored the catalytic activity of the above two nanohybrids toward the HDO of vanillin, a typical compound of lignin-derived bio-oil to 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol, which is a promising future biofuel. The CoxP@POP exhibited superior catalytic activity and selectivity toward desired product with improved stability compared to the Co3O4@POP. Based on advanced sample characterization results, the extraordinary selectivity of CoxP@POP is attributed to the strong interaction of the cation of the CoxP nanoparticle with the POP matrix and the consequent modifications of the electronic states. Through attenuated total reflectance-infrared spectroscopy, we have also observed different interaction strengths between vanillin and the two catalysts. The decreased catalytic activity of Co3O4@POP compared to CoxP@POP catalyst could be attributed to the stronger adsorption of vanillin over the Co3O4@POP catalyst. Also from kinetic investigation, it is clearly demonstrated that the Co3O4@POP has higher activation energy barrier than the CoxP@POP, which also reflects to the reduction of the overall efficiency of the Co3O4@POP catalyst. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach in POP-encapsulated cobalt phosphide catalyst synthesis and comprehensive study in establishing the structure-activity relationship in significant step-forwarding in promoting biomass refining. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","ATR-IR; biofuel; cobalt phosphide; hydrodeoxygenation (HDO); porous organic polymer; vanillin","Activation energy; Biofuels; Cobalt compounds; Infrared spectroscopy; Lignin; Nanocatalysts; Nanoparticles; Nanostructured materials; Synthesis (chemical); Attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy; Cobalt phosphide; Hydrodeoxygenation; Kinetic investigations; Porous organic polymers; Sequential synthesis; Structure activity relationships; vanillin; Catalyst activity; Activation Energy; Cobalt Compounds; Infrared Spectroscopy; Oil; Selectivity; Synthesis; Vanillin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069624849

We use the case of aviation biofuel (biokerosene) to explore the complications around signalling in strategic niche management processes. Biokerosene is currently supplied at several Scandinavian airports in a low percentage blend, either as standard or upon request, although trials suggest that modern jet engines can reliably handle much higher percentage blends. Airlines, airports and biokerosene suppliers cooperate in a process of mutual strategic positioning that supports confidence-building and market development, while at the same time being intended to encourage positive stakeholder perceptions. A key challenge for the sector, however, is that signalling biokerosene as a response to aviation-related climate emissions is complicated by mixed societal perceptions of biofuel sustainability; and the policy and material conditions for affordable, sustainable, large scale supply of biofuel are lacking. Thus while parts of the sector would like to more clearly signal the value of existing and greater biokerosene use, interrelationships between reputational risks, supply constraints and economics limit this. By bringing stakeholder management theory to strategic niche management, we present a view of the latter as in part reputationally driven, in response to the uncertain legitimacy of a technology at an early stage in its market development. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Aviation biofuel; Biokerosene; Signalling; Strategic niche management","Commerce; Signaling; Sustainable development; Biokerosene; Confidence building; Material conditions; Stakeholder management; Stakeholder perception; Strategic niche management; Strategic positioning; Sustainability transition; Biofuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063783099

The electrode is fabricated by drop-casting graphene-polyethylenimine (G-P) composites on carbon papers (CPs) precoated with graphene oxide (GO). The negatively charged hSO can be adsorbed electrostatically on the positively charged matrix (G-P) on CP electrodes coated with GO (CPG), with a proper orientation for accelerated DET. Notably, further electrochemical reduction of G-P on CPG electrodes leads to a 9-fold increase of the saturation catalytic current density (jm) for sulfite oxidation reaching 24.4 ± 0.3 μA cm-2, the highest value among reported DET-based hSO bioelectrodes. The increased electron transfer rate plays a dominating role in the enhancement of direct enzymatic current because of the improved electric contact of hSO with the electrode. The optimized hSO bioelectrode shows a significant catalytic rate (kcat: 25.6 ± 0.3 s-1) and efficiency (kcat/Km: 0.231 ± 0.003 s-1 μM-1) compared to the reported hSO bioelectrodes. The assembly of the hSO bioanode and a commercial platinum biocathode allows the construction of sulfite/O2 enzymatic biofuel cells (EBFCs) with flowing fuels. The optimized EBFC displays an open-circuit voltage (OCV) of 0.64 ± 0.01 V and a maximum power density of 61 ± 6 μW cm-2 (122 ± 12 mW m-3) at 30 °C, which exceeds the best reported value by more than 6 times. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","carbon paper; direct electron transfer; enzymatic biofuel cell; reduced graphene oxide; sulfite oxidase","Biofuels; Catalytic oxidation; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrochemical oxidation; Electrolytic reduction; Electron transitions; Enzymatic fuel cells; Graphite electrodes; Open circuit voltage; Paper; Carbon paper; Direct electron transfer; Electrochemical reductions; Electron transfer rates; Maximum power density; Reduced graphene oxides; Sulfite oxidase; Threedimensional (3-d); Graphene",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068386604

It is shown that the Ni/Al2O3 and Ni–Cu/Al2O3 catalysts are active in this process. With them, the hydrodeoxygenation of methyl ester of hexadecanoic acid mixed with ethyl ester of decanoic acid results in the formation of С6−С16 alkanes and oxygen-containing products, while methane and ethane can be found in the gas phase. When the Ni : Cu ratio in the catalysts is lowered, the conversion of esters and the capability of these catalysts for C–C bond hydrogenolysis are reduced. This means the introduction of copper can promote retention of the carbon skeleton of alkanes obtained as a result of hydrodeoxygenation, along with the amount of methane. According to X-ray diffraction data, introducing copper into the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst results in the formation of Ni1 – xCux solid solutions. According to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data, lowering the content of copper in the Ni–Cu/Al2O3 catalyst raises the Ni : Cu ratio on a sample’s surface. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","biofuel; hydrocarbon fuel; hydrodeoxygenation; vegetable oils","Biofuels; Catalyst selectivity; Copper; Esters; Methane; Nickel; Oxygen; Palmitic acid; Paraffins; Saturated fatty acids; Vegetable oils; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Active components; Carbon skeleton; Hexadecanoic acid; Hydrocarbon fuel; Hydrodeoxygenation; Ni/Al2O3 catalyst; Nickel catalyst; X-ray diffraction data; Catalyst activity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073071123

Herein, Sn 4+ -induced highly dispersed Cu-based catalyst, Cu/Zn-Al-Sn layered double hydroxide (Cu/ZnAlSn-LDH), is delicately constructed for catalytic transfer hydrodeoxygenation of vanillin to promising 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol (MMP) biofuel using 2-propanol as hydrogen source and solvent without any external hydrogen supply. Nearly total MMP yield is achieved under moderate reaction conditions (180 °C, 4 h) and the turnover number (TON) value calculated in Cu/ZnAlSn-LDH is about 3 times higher than that in Sn-free catalyst (Cu/ZnAl-LDH). Characterizations results reveal that the Sn 4+ species confined in the lattice of brucite-like layer of ZnAlSn-LDH are existed in electron-rich state, which can promote the formation of smaller Cu nanoparticles (1.95 nm) in Cu/ZnAlSn-LDH compared to those in Sn-free Cu/ZnAl-LDH catalyst (6.08 nm), as well as stronger metal-support interaction, thus leading to the higher catalytic performance and stability.

The synthesized nanocatalyst was characterized to determine the structural and morphological properties, using BET, XRD, TGA, FTIR, ICP, and TEM. Characterization results reported that the catalyst calcinated at 900°C exhibits good catalytic property. The catalyst was utilized for the production of biodiesel, under different reaction parameters through transesterification process. Response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural network (ANN) were employed to evaluate the best combination of molar ratio, catalyst concentration, and reaction time for transesterification process. By using point prediction method, the optimum yield of 96% was achieved at the catalyst concentration of 9.5 wt% of oil, 1:12 molar ratio, and 121-minute reaction time. The physiochemical properties of the biodiesel were determined, and the result suggested that the biodiesel produced met ASTM D6751 standard.

Here, we developed new alumina microsphere (AMS) supported bimetallic NiCu catalysts with a hierarchical flower-like architecture for highly efficient catalytic transfer hydrogenation of biomass-derived ethyl levulinate (EL) to γ-valerolactone (GVL), which were derived from flower-like core-shell structured AMS@Ni-Cu-Al layered double hydroxide precursors (AMS@NiCuAl-LDH). Various characterizations demonstrated that the reduction of NiCuAl-LDH precursors in situ grown on the AMS could generate bimetallic NiCu alloy nanoparticles embedded into surface standing and intercrossed LDH-derived alumina nanoplatelets (ANPs), thereby forming a novel hierarchical multilevel AMS@NiCu@ANPs superstructure. As-fabricated bimetallic NiCu catalyst with 0.5 Cu/Ni molar ratio exhibited enhanced activity for catalytic transfer hydrogenation, in comparison with monometallic and other bimetallic ones, owing to the synergy between Ni-Cu species in highly dispersed bimetallic NiCu nanoparticles, i.e., the electronic effect, favorable surface acid-base property, and highly porous architecture. Moreover, the catalyst possessed good stability and recyclability, due to strong interactions between ANPs and AMS support, as well as between NiCu NPs and ANPs matrix. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Binary alloys; Catalyst activity; Catalyst supports; Copper compounds; Hydrogenation; Molar ratio; Nanoparticles; Catalytic transfer hydrogenation; Electronic effects; Hierarchical multilevel; Layered double hydroxides; Porous architectures; Strong interaction; Surface acid-base property; Value-added chemicals; Copper alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067366395

Herein, a benign and eco-friendly approach using low-cost formamide (FAM) and FA as nitrogen and hydrogen source, respectively, was developed to be highly efficient for the synthesis of 5-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (MPLD, up to 93% yield) from LA under quasi-catalytic and solvent-free conditions in a relatively short reaction time of 90 min at 160 °C. Deuterium-labeled and control experiments with 2D NMR illustrated the occurrence of transfer hydroamination process, where FA acted as an acid as well as H-donor. The smooth proceeding of the initial C-N bond formation process mainly contributed to the rapid substrate conversion, while the concurrent amidation process was favorable for the subsequent cyclization to give the desired lactam, as proved by computational calculations and kinetic studies. In addition, this quasi-catalytic system was applicable to the synthesis of various N-unprotected lactams in 76-95% yields from keto acids under benign conditions, and the target product could be simply isolated by extraction. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","Amination and amidation; Biomass conversion; Levulinic acid; Solvent-free; Sustainable catalysis; Transfer hydrogenation","Amides; Amination; Amines; Bioconversion; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Organic acids; Amidation; Biomass conversion; Levulinic acid; Solvent free; Transfer hydrogenations; Catalysts",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066412597

In this study the hydrothermal stability and acidic property of Al-MCM-41 were improved by addition of Ce element into its structure with various amounts of Si/Ce molar ratio. Then it was loaded by magnesium with two different procedures: customary impregnation and Sono-dispersion. The following techniques were utilized to characterize the synthesized nanocatalysts: EDX, FTIR, FESEM, DRS, BET and XRD. The catalytic performance of bifunctional nanocatalysts for biodiesel production from acidic oil was analysed, while four operational parameters were fixed as: catalyst charge equal to 5 wt%, reaction temperature equal to 70 °C, reaction duration equal to 6 h and methanol/oil molar ratio equal to 9. Generally, the obtained results revealed that the conversion and the quality of produced biodiesel were increased significantly by increasing Ce amount of catalysts up to Si/Ce = 25 and also the sonicated sample represented a better reusability compare to non-sonicated one.

Reaction parameters, like time, metal loading on ZrO2-MCM-41, catalyst loading, temperature, H2 pressure and solvent, were optimized for the conversion of HMF to DMF using prepared catalyst. The investigation performed in this study shows that Ru supported on ZrO2-MCM-41 is highly active and selective catalyst for effective transformation of the HMF into DMF in high yield and selectivity. With the use of 2 wt % Ru-ZrO2-MCM-41 catalyst, 90% yield of DMF was obtained from HMF with very short reaction time of 1 h. The catalyst was recycled upto six time with slight decrease in yield after 4th cycle.

From the economic and environmental protection points of view, utilization of waste frying oil for the production of biodiesel addresses very beneficial impacts. Production of higher yield of biodiesel is a challenging process in order to commercialize it with a lower cost. The current study focuses on the influence of different parameters such as reaction temperature (°C), reaction period (min), oil to methanol ratio and amount of catalyst (wt%) on the production of biodiesel. The main objective of this work is to develop a model via fuzzy logic approach in order to maximize the biodiesel produced from waste frying oil using montmorillonite Clay K-30 as a catalyst. The optimization for the operating parameters has been performed via particle swarm optimization (PSO) approach. During the optimization process, the decision variables were represented by four different operating parameters: temperature (40–140 °C), reaction period (60–300 min), oil/methanol ratio (1:6–1:18) and amount of catalyst (1–5 wt%). The model has been validated with the experimental data and compared with the optimal results reported based on other optimization techniques. Results showed the increment of biodiesel production by 15% using the proposed strategy compared to the earlier study. The obtained biodiesel production yield reached 93.70% with the optimal parameters for a temperature at 69.66 °C, a reaction period of 300 min, oil/methanol ratio of 1:9 and an amount of catalyst of 5 wt%. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biodiesel; Clay-based catalyst; Fuzzy logic; Optimization; Waste frying oil","Alternative fuels; Biodiesel; Catalysts; Clay minerals; Computer circuits; Driers (materials); Environmental technology; Fuzzy logic; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Biodiesel production; Environmental concerns; Fuzzy logic approach; Montmorillonite clay; Optimization techniques; Parameters optimization; Reaction temperature; Waste frying oil; Well stimulation; biodiesel; methanol; montmorillonite; unclassified drug; waste frying oil; bentonite; biofuel; vegetable oil; biofuel; catalyst; clay; fuzzy mathematics; montmorillonite; optimization; parameterization; algorithm; Article; biofuel production; calculation; catalysis; chemical reaction; fermentation optimization; frying; fuzzy logic; mathematical model; priority journal; process optimization; temperature; chemistry; fuzzy logic; theoretical model; waste; Bentonite; Biofuels; Fuzzy Logic; Garbage; Models, Theoretical; Plant Oils",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061979914

Calcium Oxide (CaO) was selected as a basic heterogeneous catalyst because it is the cheapest and the most available comparing with other options. The characteristics of the catalyst were evaluated using several evaluation tests. The results confirm that the best preparation condition is at 850ºC and 2 hours. This catalyst has demonstrated positive results, high productivity and good recycling potential. The best conditions for reaction were obtained by varying the reaction conditions to obtain the highest bio-fuel production. The reaction has been studied in various operating conditions of methanol to oil molar ratio, catalyst loading, agitation speed and reaction time at temperature 65ºC. The maximum yield of biodiesel was 97.4% for fresh vegetable oil. Moreover, the catalyst shows perfect results for transesterification of waste vegetable oil. It was tested for market waste sunflower oil and home waste sunflower oil, where the yield was 88.2% and 91.6% respectively. The reuse of the catalyst showed good activity with no less than 5 cycles.

This study aims to investigate the catalytic behaviors of the transition metal oxides (CoO, Cr2O3, CuO, Fe2O3, Mn2O3, NiO, TiO2 and V2O5) as well as CeO2 for the catalytic pyrolysis of poplar wood. The metal oxides, especially TiO2 and NiO could suppress further cracking of primary products, increasing the tar yield and simultaneously decreasing the gas yield. The V, Mn, Ti or Co-based catalyst promoted the formation of the heavy bio-oil, while the Ce, Cr, Cu or Fe-based catalysts were the opposite. The metal oxides (except Fe2O3) promoted the formation of alcohols, furan, ketones, acetic acid and phenolics in bio-oil. Fe2O3 catalysts suppressed formation of the derivatives from cellulose and hemicellulose except hydroxyl acetone. Hydroxyl acetone formation was promoted by almost all the oxide catalysts while hydroxyl aldehyde formation was the opposite. Remarkable coke formed over the V, Mn, Cu and Co-based catalysts.

The aim of this study was to replace a homogeneous alkaline catalyst with a heterogeneous catalyst on the carbon support. The use of a carbon enables the catalyst to be reusable in the production process, eliminates the formation of soaps and increases the glycerol purity. Fatty acid methyl esters were obtained from the transesterification of corn oil using KOH supported on activated carbon (KOH/AC). The effect of the molar ratio of methanol to oil, reaction time and catalyst amount were used to optimize the transesterification reaction. The optimum condition for waste corn oil transesterification to methyl ester was obtained below 0.75 wt.% catalyst amount. The yield was up to 92 wt.% at 62.5 °C, 1 h reaction time and 3:1 methanol-to-oil ratio.

Therefore, acid esterification is a suitable route to reduce its FFA content to an acceptable limit (2 FFA%) before being subjected to further transesterification. In the present study, Jatropha seeds were utilized as the feedstock directly instead of Jatropha oil during ultrasound-assisted in situ esterification. The objective of this work is to evaluate the feasibility of in situ esterification of Jatropha oil seeds using sulphuric acid (H 2 SO 4 ) as catalyst with the aid of ultrasound. RESULTS: The reaction parameters (particle size, n-hexane to methanol volume ratio, H 2 SO 4 amount, reaction time and ultrasonic amplitude) were optimized and evaluated in term of extraction and esterification efficiencies as well as fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) yield. The highest extraction efficiency of 83.96%, esterification efficiency of 71.10% and FAME yield of 38.58% were achieved at particle size of 1–2 mm, n-hexane to methanol volume ratio of 3:1, 5 vol% of H 2 SO 4 and ultrasonic amplitude of 60% with reaction time of 150 min. CONCLUSION: Synthesis of biodiesel via ultrasound-assisted in situ esterification of Jatropha oil seeds was successful with considerable yield, which could provide improvement in terms of process intensification and more value added by-products. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry","biofuel; free fatty acid; in situ esterification; Jatropha seeds; sulphuric acid; ultrasound","Biodiesel; Biofuels; Chemical industry; Efficiency; Esterification; Esters; Extraction; Hexane; Methanol; Oilseeds; Particle size; Sulfuric acid; Synthetic fuels; Ultrasonics; Biodiesel synthesis; Extraction efficiencies; Fatty acid methyl ester; Free fatty acid; High free fatty acids; Jatropha; Process intensification; Ultrasonic amplitude; Fatty acids; biodiesel; fatty acid ester; hexane; methanol; sulfuric acid; Article; catalyst; esterification; feasibility study; Jatropha curcas; nonhuman; oilseed; particle size; reaction analysis; reaction time; ultrasound assisted in situ esterification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058702487

To date, one-pot conversion of furfural with cellulosic ethanol is mostly limited to the synthesis of C5-C7 hydrocarbons, poising a challenge for the production of high-energy density fuel from biomass-derived compounds. In this study, we present gold nanoparticles supported over nickel oxide (Au/NiO) as robust catalysts for selective conversion of furfural to hydrocarbons. The catalysts present ∼92% furfural conversion with ∼81% selectivity toward the production of C7 and C9 hydrocarbons through a one-pot cascade reaction, viz., cross-aldol condensations in the presence of ethanol, O2, and K2CO3, followed by a hydrogenolysis process using H2(g). Results indicate the unprecedented production of C9 from furfural and ethanol is yielded via in situ cross-aldol condensation of 3-(2-furyl)acrolein, an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde that is evolved in the reaction medium. Analysis shows the promising catalytic performance of the Au/NiO composite for the furfural conversion can attribute with synergic effects at the interface of the Au nanoparticles and the NiO, offering potential active sites for the reaction.

Separate hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of EN and RH showed bio-oil yields of 26.0% and 45.6%, respectively. However, co-HTL under optimized conditions showed significant increase in the bio-oil yield by 71.7% over that of EN, and insignificant difference with that of RH. Nevertheless, the conversion ratio of co-HTL showed 10.6% significant increase over that of RH. GC-MS results showed that main compounds of EN and RH bio-oil lump into the C15–C20 and C5–C12 regions, mainly representing carbon range of diesel and gasoline, respectively. Short-chain (C5–C12) and long-chain (C14–C20) compounds in the bio-oil obtained by co-HTL represented 72% and 28%, respectively. In addition, the ratio of aromatic compounds in the bio-oil of RH was reduced by 9.3% as a result of co-HTL. In conclusion, results suggested 50% ethanol as a co-solvent, 300 °C and 45 min as optimum conditions for co-HTL of EN:RH (1:1 w/w).

The results indicated that Na2CO3 + Fe can promote the cracking of wheat stalk compared with Na2CO3 or Fe. Meanwhile, higher temperature favored the decomposition of wheat stalk and formation of heavy bio-oil. The highest heavy bio-oil yield was 24.25 wt% and the maximum liquefaction conversion rate was 89.45 wt% in system of Na2CO3 + Fe at 270 °C. The analysis results indicated that longer reaction time could promote liquefaction conversion especially for heavy bio-oil with Na2CO3 + Fe during the process of HTL.

The addition of Cu- or Ce-promoters affected the physicochemical properties of the NiMo catalyst. The NiMo catalyst promoted by Cu showed the higher reducibility, whilst the Ce-promoter (2–8 wt% based on γ-Al2O3 content) provided the NiMo catalyst with a higher distribution of active metals and induced a greater difficulty in the reduction under hydrogen (H2) atmosphere. For the HDO of GUA at a mild reaction condition (10 bar initial H2 pressure and 300 °C) in the absence of solvent, the Cu-promoter enhanced the hydrogenation activity of the NiMo catalyst to convert GUA to phenol and methylphenols, one-atomic oxygen species. Whereas, the addition of Ce obviously inhibited the formation of coke on the catalyst surface after a long reaction period (6 h) and gave a higher GUA conversion level with increasing yield of phenols. For the HDO of real bio-oil obtained from the fast pyrolysis of cassava rhizome, the NiMo catalysts promoted by Cu or Ce at 4 wt% based on the γ-Al2O3 content showed a higher performance at eliminating the oxygenated compounds in the bio-oil, reducing the oxygen/carbon (O/C) molar ratio by over seven-fold from 1.75 to 0.24–0.25. Moreover, the gross heating value of the bio-oil was improved from 21.5 to ca. 29.0 MJ/kg after the HDO process. However, the addition of the Cu or Ce promoter did not inhibit coke deposition, possibly due to the acidic properties of the bio-oil that deteriorated the catalyst performance by metal leaching. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Cerium; Copper; Guaiacol; Hydrodeoxygenation; Promoter","Alcohols; Alumina; Aluminum alloys; Aluminum oxide; Binary alloys; Biofuels; Catalyst activity; Cerium; Coke; Molar ratio; Oxygen; Phenols; Physicochemical properties; Surface reactions; Catalyst performance; Gross heating value; Guaiacol; Hydrodeoxygenation; Hydrogenation activity; Mild reaction conditions; Oxygenated compounds; Promoter; Copper",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061387925

Renewable liquid fuels are highly desirable due to their potential for use in existing infrastructure, but current Fischer-Tropsch processes, which require operating pressures of 2 4 MPa (20 40 bar), are unsuitable for the relatively small scale of typical biogas production facilities in the EU, which are agriculture-based. This paper investigates the feasibility of producing liquid fuels from biogas-derived syngas at atmospheric pressure, with a focus on the system's response to various interruption factors, such as total loss of feed gas, variations to feed ratio, and technical problems in the furnace. Results of laboratory testing showed that the liquid fuel selectivity could reach 60% under the studied conditions of 488 K (215 °C), H2/CO = 2 and 0.1 MPa (1 bar) over a commercial Fischer Tropsch catalyst. Analysis indicated that the catalyst had two active sites for propagation, one site for the generation of methane and another for the production of liquid fuels and wax products. However, although the production of liquid fuels was verified at atmospheric pressure with high liquid fuel selectivity, the control of such a system to maintain activity is crucial. From an economic perspective, the system would require subsidies to achieve financial viability. © 2019 by the authors.","Ambient pressure; Anaerobic digestion; Atmospheric pressure; Biofuels; Biogas; Farm-scale; Fischer Tropsch; Liquid fuels","Anaerobic digestion; Atmospheric pressure; Biogas; Carbon monoxide; Catalyst activity; Catalyst selectivity; Coal liquefaction; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; Liquid fuels; Liquid methane; Liquids; Synthesis gas; Synthesis gas manufacture; Ambient pressures; Economic perspective; Farm scale; Financial viability; Fischer Tropsch; Fischer-Tropsch catalysts; Fischer-Tropsch process; Fischer-Tropsch reaction; Biofuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065432383

Stainless steel spheres are functionalized with Pt-nanoparticles through the use of a silane linker. These spheres are characterized via XRD, FTIR, SEM/EDX and XPS followed by generation of heating profiles in an RF induction heater. The high electric conductivity of the steel balls results in rapid heating which creates a positive temperature gradient across the surface with temperatures of the steel balls reaching 300 °C in under 20 s. Using a minimum of 3% power (150 W), temperatures over 525 °C are achieved within 150 s in a single steel ball experiment. A steel bed experiment is performed to simulate an induction-based catalytic upconversion of biomass pyrolysis vapors which indicates that temperatures over 195 °C are achieved in as little as 300 s using 5% power (250 W). Melting and degradation of the Pt nanoparticles is evident with repeated heating at temperatures of 525 °C and above, fortunately, typical catalysts designed for upconversion of pyrolysis oils are operating well below these temperatures.

Higher temperature, time, and catalyst loading would decrease the yield of HPO and increase the yield of gaseous product whereas contrary results were observed with increasing the H 2 pressure. With added noble metals, the hydrodenitrogenation, hydroSization, and hydrodeoxygenation reactions of the HPO were promoted and greatly lowered N, O, and S contents of the HPO with increasing the temperature, time, catalyst loading, and H 2 pressure. The lowest N, O, and S contents of 0.02, 0.41 and 0.41 wt% of HPO were achieved at 430 °C, 60 min, 10 wt% Ru/C, and 12 MPa H 2 . The higher-heating value of the HPOs varied between 44 and 46 MJ/kg depending on the reaction conditions. More than half of the energy of the ST was converted into the HPO. The HPO mainly consisted of saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons one to five benzene derivatives. The distillate fraction between 35 and 250 °C of the HPO is more than 80 wt%.

Bimetallic nano-catalysts have gained importance in recent years due to their excellent selectivity and activity. In this paper, a magnetically separable Fe-Pd/C bimetallic nano-catalyst was developed which not only showed excellent selectivity to DMF but also helped reduce the noble metal consumption, thereby making the catalyst cheaper. Using XPS, XRD and TPR characterizarion techniques, the Fe-Pd/C catalyst was found to exist as bimetallic containing a partially oxidized Fe and reduced Pd atoms. It exhibited 85% selectivity towards DMF with 100% conversion of HMF. The reaction was conducted in a liquid-acid-free environment, thus making the process environmental friendly. The oxidized Fe imparts magnetic properties to the catalyst making it easy to recover. The catalyst was found to be robust and showed excellent activity on repeated use. Overall a highly efficient, economic and green process for DMF synthesis was developed based on biomass as feedstock. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","2,5-Dimethylfuran; 5-Hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF); Bimetallic catalyst; Fe-Pd/C; Green chemistry; Selective hydrogenation","Aldehydes; Fossil fuels; Furfural; Hydrogenation; Nanocatalysts; Precious metals; 2,5-Dimethylfuran; 5-Hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF); Bimetallic catalysts; Green chemistry; Selective hydrogenation; Catalyst selectivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058970705

To this end, the combustion synthesis (CS) and microwave heating were applied for the synthesis of MgAl2O4, and impregnation was used for the dispersion of MgO active phase on the given samples. The characterization of samples was done using TGA, XRD, BET, BJH, FTIR, FESEM, and EDX to reach the optimal glycine fuel ratio for CS. The best physiochemical properties were observed in 1.5 ratio. The pore size, the surface area, and the mean pore diameter of the mentioned nanocatalyst were respectively 0.358 cm3/g, 93.8 m2/g, and 5 nm. Finally, transesterification reaction was employed for the preparation of biodiesel to measure the nanocatalysts activity. The findings showed that the nanocatalyst produced by hybrid microwave-impregnation method with fuel ration of 1.5 (at the presence of glycine) is highly desirable for biodiesel production. Using optimal sample, transesterification reaction conversion reached 92.7%. Reusability investigation of the optimal catalyst showed that this sample possessed a relatively good reusability for biodiesel production.

One of the most widely inquired heterogeneous catalysts in biodiesel production is calcium oxide (CaO) due to some advantages such as low price and high activity. Unfortunately, this compound is leached by methanol, and in this case, compounds such as CaO and ZnO have been suggested as an alternative to avoid this unwanted phenomenon. According to this, in the current work mixed oxides of calcium–zinc catalysts were synthesized using the co-precipitation method, and later, they were characterized and their behaviors were studied identifying transesterification yields and catalysts life cycle varying some of its operational conditions. Methanol/oil ratio over catalyst amount and Zn/Ca atomic ratio were identified as the main factors that affect the transesterification reaction yield. The maximum yield was 86.99%, obtained with 7.5 wt% catalyst, Zn/Ca atomic ratio of 3.0, methanol/oil molar ratio of 30:1 and a reaction time of 2 h at 56.9 °C. To test its reactivation capacity, a reactivated catalyst with the best behavior was used again obtaining a yield of 83.87% which indicates an insignificant decrease in its catalytic activity. However, the leaching process was detected which does not allow a decrease in purification costs due to residual calcium oxide. © 2018, Islamic Azad University (IAU).","Biodiesel; Mixed oxides Ca–Zn; Reusing analysis; Transesterification reaction","Biodiesel; Diesel fuels; II-VI semiconductors; Leaching; Life cycle; Lime; Methanol; Palm oil; Precipitation (chemical); Transesterification; Zinc oxide; Biodiesel production; Coprecipitation method; Heterogeneous catalyst; Mixed oxide; Operational conditions; Refined palm oil; Reusing analysis; Transesterification reaction; Catalyst activity; biofuel; calcium; catalyst; chemical method; fossil fuel; heterogeneity; leaching; lime; methanol; oxide group; precipitation (chemistry); zinc",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047939867

Best results were obtained with gasoline:ethanol mixtures in the ratio 9:1 (E10), as ethanol acts as a solvent mediator for the dissolution of HMF. Selected potential biofuels are also found to give high DMF yields, for example, several alcohols (81-92%) and 2-butanone (94%), while γ-valerolacton and saturated hydrocarbons show limitations (75% and 37%, respectively). The reaction in gasoline is conducted sequentially up to three times with an initial loading of 10 wt % HMF per step, resulting in a concentration increase of up to 7 wt % DMF for each step, by which a concentration range between 7 and 20 wt % DMF in the final blend is covered. The obtained blends were evaluated by the determination of the derived cetane number (DCN) and a simulated distillation with comparison to premixed blends and proved to be comparable in a wide concentration range of DMF (5-15 wt %). Thus, a potentially directly usable fuel blend is produced in a direct conversion process without the need of costly separation.

The aim of this work was to analyze the state of the art on urban, agricultural and livestock solid waste in terms of quantity and composition, as well as to analyze the concept of biorefineries from the viewpoint of their design as a sustainable alternative for the use of residual raw materials. The information was consulted in different databases such as Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar. The analysis of the information identified that the residues are produced in considerable amounts and have valuable organic compounds, which are used to a greater or lesser extent according to technological, cultural, and socio-economic factors in each specific region. New policies are needed for the integral management of solid waste that integrates the concept of biorefineries from the generation and separation at the source to its utilization and final disposal. The proper implementation of physical, thermochemical, chemical, and biological processes under the concept of biorefineries can recover or transform in an integral way the residual raw materials to obtain products such as biofuels, food, and energy. Designing biorefineries to determine their viability for waste utilization is required. Exploring this type of alternatives by evaluating different factors (techno-economic, environmental, and social) may support the decision making of investment and research in utilization technologies to be implemented on a small or large scale in regions of Colombia and the world with great waste availability © 2019.

In this report, we describe the development of new three-dimensional (3D) bioelectrodes by immobilizing a “bioink” of glucose oxidase (GOD) in a matrix of reduced graphene oxides (RGOs), polyethylenimine (PEI), and ferrocene carboxylic acid (FcCOOH) on carbon paper (CP). CP with 3D interwoven carbon fibers serves as a solid porous and electronically conducting skeleton, providing large surface areas and space for loading the bioink and diffusion of substrate molecules, respectively. RGO enhances contact between the GOD-matrix and CP, maintaining high conductivity. The composition of the bioink has been systematically optimized. The GOD bioelectrodes show linearly increasing electrocatalytic oxidation current toward glucose concentration up to 48 mM. A hybrid enzymatic biofuel cell equipped with the GOD bioelectrode as a bioanode and a platinum cathode furthermore registers a maximum power density of 5.1 μW cm−2 and an open circuit voltage of 0.40 V at 25°C.

Experimental validation for treating biogas slurries from digested cattle manure, fish intestine, and wheat straw was performed on Ni/α-Al2O3 catalyst. The results showed that the total organic carbon, total nitrogen, and PO4 3- ion contents in biogas slurry could be reduced by 98.69, 98.01, and 99.32%, respectively. The highest hydrogen yield was obtained in the treatment of biogas slurry from digested cattle manure at 750 °C, in which the hydrogen yield and hydrogen concentration were 13.85 Lhydrogen/LBS and 79.77 vol %, respectively. Changes in the crystalline phase and structure of the catalyst were observed during catalytic reforming of biogas slurry. Active metal oxidization and carbon deposition were likely to be important factors affecting catalytic stability. The mass flow evaluation verified the hydrogen generation potential by the catalytic reforming of biogas slurry, which was close to the methane generation capability of the upstream biogas plant.

Furfural, resulting from the depolymerization of hemicellulose, is often considered as an extremely interesting platform molecule. Particularly, new biofuels containing molecules with 8 and 13 carbon atoms can be produced from aldol condensation of furfural and acetone followed by a deoxygenation reaction. In this work, several magnesium hydroxide fluorides MgF2-x(OH)x were prepared by a sol-gel method with various F/Mg ratios (0 to 2) at 100 °C. All solid samples were fully characterized by several techniques (nitrogen adsorption-desorption, TEM, IR, XRD and ICP). MgF2-x(OH)x were mainly composed of an intimate mixture of MgF2 and Mg(OH)2-x(OCH3)x and exhibited both acid-base properties and high surface areas. From CO2 adsorption experiments, a basicity scale corresponding to basic sites with moderate strength was established: MgF1.5(OH)0.5 &gt; MgF(OH) ∼ MgF1.75(OH)0.25 &gt; MgF0.5(OH)1.5 &gt; Mg(OH)2 ≫ MgF2. It was proposed that the presence of fluorine allowed stabilization of the basic sites with moderate strength at ambient atmosphere. The aldol condensation of furfural and acetone was carried out under mild reaction conditions (50 °C, Patm) over MgF2-x(OH)x. These catalysts were involved in this reaction without using a classical activation step for basic solid catalysts, which constitutes a major advantage of energy conservation and thus, economic efficiency. The solid with a F/Mg ratio equal to 1.5 (MgF1.5(OH)0.5) exhibited the highest activity, the furanic dimer (1,5-di(furan-2-yl)penta-1,4-dien-3-one) being the main product. A good correlation between the catalytic activity and the basicity scale was highlighted. Based on these results, the nature of active sites was proposed: a combination of a Lewis acid site (coordinatively unsaturated metal site) in the vicinity of a basic site (hydroxyl groups of Mg(OH)2-x(OCH3)x).

In this study, oxide-supported nanogold catalysts exhibit good catalytic performance in ethanol conversion with cinnamaldehyde and finally give rise to the C11-C13 hydrocarbon. High selectivity (70%) for C11-C13 hydrocarbons is achieved over Au/NiO via a one-pot cascade reaction, viz. cross-aldol condensations in the presence of oxygen and base (K2CO3) and then full hydrodeoxygenation with hydrogen gas. EtOH-TPD and TGA analyses show that the ethanol is activated to acetaldehyde (CH3CHO∗) over the surface oxygen vacancies of the NiO support. The CH3CHO∗ then reacts with cinnamaldehyde at the interfacial perimeter of the Au/NiO composite during the cascade reactions, as evidenced by comparison of the catalytic performance with that over another oxide-supported Au NP, chemo-adsorption investigations, and in situ infrared spectroscopy investigations.

Herein, we developed a scale-up and sustainable method to fabricate gram-quantities of highly dispersed cobalt nanocatalysts sheathed in multilayered N-doped graphene (Co@NG) by using a biomacromolecule carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) as a raw material. The ionic gelation of CMC, urea and Co2+ ions leads to uniform dispersion and chelation of different species, consequently resulting in the formation of highly distributed Co nanoparticles (NPs) (10.91 nm) with N-enriched graphene shells in the solid-state thermolysis process. The usage of urea as a non-corrosive activation agent can introduce a porous belt-like nanostructure and abundant doped nitrogen. Among all the prepared catalysts in this work, the optimized Co@NG-6 with the largest specific surface area (627 m2 g-1), the most and strongest basic sites, and the highest proportion of pyridinic-N (37.6%) and mesopores exhibited excellent catalytic activity (99% yield of 2-methoxy-p-cresol) for base-free transfer hydrodeoxygenation (THD) of vanillin using bioderived formic acid (FA) as a H source at 160 °C for 6 h. The poisoning tests and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra verified that the strong interaction between N atoms and encapsulated Co NPs provided synergistic effects, which were essential for the outstanding catalytic performance of Co@NG-6. The deuterium kinetic isotope effect study clearly demonstrated that the formation of Co-H-via β-hydride elimination and protonation was the rate-determining step, and protic N-H+ and hydridic Co-H- were considered to be active intermediate species in the THD reaction. Furthermore, Co@NG-6 was highly stable for recycling owing to the graphene shells preventing Co NPs from corrosion and aggregation. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072130773

S. foetida contains 40% oil content and low free fatty acid value (0.18 mg KOH/g). The synthesized nanocatalyst was characterized using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) techniques. The maximum conversion was achieved (92% yield) using CuO-CeO2 at 0.25% catalyst loading. The optimized reaction was carried out by experimental variables included molar ratio (1:9), temperature (70°C), reaction time (3 h) and stirring rate (600 rpm) using reflux transesterification method. The XRD results showed the size of crystals with order 54.4 nm for CuO-CeO2 and 31.3 nm for Fe2O3. The SEM images of CuO-CeO2 showed spherical structure having an average particle size of 32.3 nm. SEM images of Fe2O3showed the size ranges from 46.27 to 28.76 nm having regular morphology, including spherical shape. The FT-IR analysis of this nanocatalyst also reinforced the results of this study. Gas Chromatography Mass Spectroscopy (GC-MS) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) confirmed the efficient conversion of S. foetida seed oil into biodiesel using prepared nanocatalysts.

Biodiesel could also be produced via interesterification ensuring full conversion of oil to biofuel, consisting of FAME and triacetin. The most effective catalysts for interesterification reactions are alkali metal alkoxides. The effectivity of alkoxide catalyst depends on its solubility determined by the structure of the alkyl chain. In our previous studies, we have shown that the branched chain catalyst tert-BuOK/THF is highly suitable for the realisation of interesterification reactions. Till now, in the scientific literature, very little is known about the influence of metal ions. In order to investigate the influence of counterion on the activity of alkoxide catalysts, in this work, we have investigated the proceeding of interesterification reactions of rapeseed oil with methyl acetate in the presence of lithium, sodium, and potassium tert-butoxides in THF. Experimentally obtained relationships for catalyst-to-oil molar ratio (COMR) influence rapeseed oil interesterifications with methyl acetate at 55°C for 1 h, with methyl acetate-to-oil molar ratio (MAOMR) 18 showing that the tert-BuONa/THF and tert-BuOK/THF have high and similar activity, but the tert-BuOLi/THF is fundamentally different. The low and diverse activity of lithium tert-butoxide can be explained by the association of ions and very low catalytic activity of ion pairs. Simulation of the influence of association on the FAME formation shows that at COMR 0.1 (sufficient for fast reaction proceeding in the presence of tert-BuONa/THF and tert-BuOK/THF), the concentration of tert-butoxide ions in the presence of tert-BuOLi/THF because of associations lowers from 28 mmol/L to 13 mmol/L, whcih is not sufficient for effective proceeding of reaction. Activity of alkoxides in this reaction is solely determined by the counterion. © 2019 Valdis Kampars et al.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063535343

During the calcination of Zn/Co-ZIF, Zn was dislocated from the framework to the particle surface to form amorphous ZnO NPs and metallic Co NPs, which activated the growth of the N-CNTs. Because of the highly Lewis acidic amorphous ZnO, high HD/HDO ability of metallic Co NPs, and high wettability of the N-CNT, an almost complete conversion of vanillin into its corresponding deoxygenated species, creosol, was achieved in an aqueous medium without the production of byproducts under mild reaction conditions (150 °C, 0.7 MPa H2, a reaction time of 2 h). When kraft lignin and bio-oil derived from concentrated strong acid hydrolysis lignin were converted over ZnO/Co@N-CNTs, high degrees of deoxygenation of 74.2% and 34.4%, respectively, could be achieved at 350 °C, 5.0 MPa H2, and a reaction time of 6 h in water. A detailed chemical composition analysis of the deoxygenated bio-oil revealed that cyclohexanone and its alkyl group-substituted derivatives were the major species. To gain insight into the HD/HDO mechanisms, various types of lignin-derived monomers (syringaldehyde, acetovanillone, acetosyringone, 2-phenoxy-1-phenylethanol, cinnamaldehyde, isoeugenol) and holocellulose-derived monomers (furfural and 5-hydroxymethyl furfural), different types of catalysts, and various reaction parameters were tested.

In addition, the effect of reaction temperature and catalyst loading was studied to evaluate the order of reaction and activation energy. Decarboxylation and decarbonylation were the dominant deoxygenation pathways. Stearic acid was successfully deoxygenated in N2 atmospheres using Co/NaX catalysts with a conversion as high as 83.7% and a yield to heptadecane up to ~28%. Furthermore, we demonstrate that higher reaction temperatures resulted in competing pathways of decarboxylation and decarbonylation. Finally, the fresh and recycled catalysts were characterized showing modest recyclability with a ~12.5% loss in catalytic activity. © 2019 by the authors.

In the present study, renewable fuel with petrodiesel-like properties was produced via catalytic deoxygenation of oleic acid in the absence of hydrogen (H 2 ). The deoxygenation pathway of oleic acid to bio-hydrocarbon involves decarboxylation/decarbonylation of the oxygen content from the fatty acid structure in the form of carbon dioxide (CO 2 )/carbon monoxide (CO), with the presence of a goat manure supported Ni-Al hydrotalcite (Gm/Ni-Al) catalyst. Goat manure is an abundant bio-waste, containing a high mineral content, urea as well as cellulosic fiber of plants, which is potentially converted into activated carbon. Synthesis of Gm/Ni-Al was carried out by incorporation of pre-activated goat manure (GmA) during co-precipitation of Ni-Al catalyst with 1 : 3, 1 : 1 and 3 : 1 ratios. The physico-chemical properties of the catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffractometry (XRD), Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) surface area, field emission surface electron microscopy (FESEM) and temperature program desorption ammonia (TPD-NH 3 ) analysers. The catalytic deoxygenation reaction was performed in a batch reactor and the product obtained was characterized by using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GCMS) for compound composition identification as well as gas chromatography-flame ionisation detector (GC-FID) for yield and selectivity determination. The optimization and evaluation were executed using response surface methodology (RSM) in conjunction with central composite design (CCD) with 5-level-3-factors. From the RSM reaction model, it was found that the Gm/Ni-Al 1 : 1 catalysed deoxygenation reaction gives the optimum product yield of 97.9% of hydrocarbon in the range of C 8 -C 20 , with diesel selectivity (C 17 : heptadecane and heptadecene compounds) of 63.7% at the optimal reaction conditions of: (1) reaction temperature: 327.14 °C, (2) reaction time: 1 h, and (3) catalyst amount: 5 wt%. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Activated carbon; Ammonia; Automotive industry; Batch reactors; Binary alloys; Biofuels; Carbon dioxide; Carboxylation; Catalysis; Catalyst selectivity; Fertilizers; Gas chromatography; Hydrocarbons; Manures; Mass spectrometry; Oleic acid; Oxygen; Urea; X ray diffraction analysis; Brunauer emmet tellers; Central composite designs; Deoxygenation reactions; Flame ionisation detector; Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopies; Optimal reaction condition; Physicochemical property; Response surface methodology; Aluminum alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060046014

The MFI zeolite nanosheets exhibit outstanding properties, such as an extremely high external surface area and appropriate acidic properties. To illustrate the beneficial effect of the hierarchical structure of the zeolite nanosheets towards green and sustainable catalytic conversion of renewable resources to high value-added chemicals, direct bioethanol dehydration to ethylene over Brønsted-acid MFI nanosheets has been studied from both experimental and theoretical points of view. Interestingly, the hierarchical structure strongly effects an increase in surface acid density at the external surfaces, eventually resulting in an improvement in ethylene selectivity. The results obtained from density functional theory (DFT) calculations also reveal that ethylene is possibly produced over the Brønsted acid sites located at the external surfaces, whereas diethyl ether (DEE) formation is the predominant pathway over the internal acid sites of MFI. From these findings, hierarchical ZSM-5 nanosheets consisting of a high fraction of active sites at the external silanol surfaces can significantly enhance the selectivity of ethylene from ethanol/bioethanol dehydration. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Bioethanol; Dehydration; Ethanol; Ethylene; Nanosheets; Surface properties; Zeolites; Beneficial effects; Bifunctional structure; Catalytic conversion; Hierarchical structures; Hierarchical ZSM-5; Hydrothermal process; Sustainable production; Value-added chemicals; Density functional theory; acidity; aluminosilicate; biofuel; catalysis; catalyst; dehydration; ethanol; ethylene; experimental study; nanoparticle; performance assessment; renewable resource",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058883605

Catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) of biomass refers both to the “in situ” and “ex situ or two-stage” upgrading. A plethora of catalytic materials have been investigated in the literature for both approaches, including conventional microporous zeolites, ordered mesoporous aluminosilicates, promoted or not with several transition metals, as well as various metal (nano)oxide catalysts with Lewis acidity. Recently, hybrid micro/mesoporous and basic materials have been also suggested exhibiting most promising results due to combined micro/mesoporosity and adequate balance of acid and basic sites. Optimum catalysts are required to retain deoxygenation, enhance yields of aromatics, and other valuable compounds (such as phenolics), while limiting coke formation. Coke formation is one of the reasons of catalyst deactivation; a very challenging issue during biomass CFP, especially using zeolites. The deactivation process is affected by many factors, including the composition of the feedstock (inorganic minerals present in the feedstock may also deposit on the catalyst), reaction conditions, and the nature/properties of the catalysts used in CFP. Precoking on the surface of zeolites or MgO deposition are among the proposed effective ways to suppress coke formation and thus, catalyst deactivation.

Castor oil (CO) and jatropha oil (JO) are the appropriate resources for biofuels because of their chemical structures and their hydrocarbon chains which are similar to fuel. This investigation was conducted to synthesize, characterize and evaluate acidic catalyst in the CC of castor and JO. The interaction between the oils and the catalyst was studied based on the brand of the produces biofuels. The effect of the concentration of the catalyst on the reaction product was studied including: viscosity, kinematic viscosity, pour point and cloud point. The results revealed that the prepared catalyst can catalyze the cracking reaction of the VOs and produce several grades of biofuels. The study displayed that the physical and fuel characteristics of the obtained biofuels are located within the ASTM specification limits.

Herein, a new dandelion-like cobalt oxide (CoOx) microsphere-supported bimetallic RuCo catalyst was fabricated by a simple one-pot embedding method and employed for the 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) hydrogenolysis to produce liquid 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) biofuel. It was found that bimetallic RuCo nanoparticles (NPs) with the average size of about 2.5 nm could homogeneously disperse on flower-like CoOx microspheres possessing abundant surface defects (i.e. oxygen vacancies and Co2+ species) simultaneously constructed. As-fabricated RuCo/CoOx catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic performance in above reaction, along with a quite high DMF yield of 96.5% at a high HMF/Ru molar ratio of 252.7, which was corelated with the unique synergy between bimetallic RuCo NPs and abundant surface defects at the metal-support interface, as well as the enhanced hydrogen spillover effect and the dandelion-like superstructure of the catalyst. Additionally, the strong interactions between RuCo species and the CoOx matrix in the RuCo/CoOx significantly prevented RuCo NPs from migration, aggregation, and leaching during the reaction. The present findings offer a new approach for designing other highly efficient and stable bimetallic catalysts applied in a variety of heterogeneous catalytic systems. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","5-Hydroxymethylfurfural; Bimetallic RuCo nanoparticles; Biomass conversion; Hydrogenolysis; Surface defects","Binary alloys; Bioconversion; Cobalt compounds; Environmental technology; Fossil fuels; Hydrogenolysis; Hydrolysis; Microspheres; Nanoparticles; Oxygen vacancies; Surface defects; 5 hydroxymethyl furfurals; Biomass conversion; Catalytic performance; Environmental pollutions; Heterogeneous catalytic systems; Hydrogen spillover effects; Metal-support interfaces; Transformation technologies; Catalyst supports",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048721822

Bio-oil, deriving from the fast pyrolysis of lignin, is a key second generation biofuel, containing high oxygen content. Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is typically employed to improve the quality of bio-oils, while the high cost of hydrogen prevents its commercialization. On the other hand, although it is the primary component of shale and natural gas, methane direct conversion to higher hydrocarbons has remained a challenge since the 1980s. Following our recent work, in the present study, methane is used to upgrade guaiacol, a well-known model compound of bio-oils, over Pt-Bi bimetallic catalysts supported on activated carbon (AC). Various characterization techniques, including transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), H2 temperature-programmed desorption (H2-TPD), H2-O2 titration, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) and temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR), were utilized to obtain catalyst structure and properties. It was found that as compared to the Pt catalyst, Pt-Bi bimetallic catalysts exhibited relatively stable (no significant deactivation) guaiacol upgrading performance for 8 h TOS (time on stream), generating partially deoxygenated products along with ethane. The addition of Bi suppresses coke formation, improving catalyst stability. The isotopic labeling tests demonstrate that ethane is produced either from coupling of two methane molecules (20-25%) or from a methane molecule combining with a methyl from guaiacol (75-80%). © 2018 American Chemical Society.","Bio-oil upgrading; Improving catalyst stability; Isotopic labeling; Methane coupling; Pt-Bi bimetallic catalysts; Shale and natural gas utilization","Activated carbon; Alcohols; Atomic emission spectroscopy; Binary alloys; Biofuels; Catalysts; Ethane; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Inductively coupled plasma; Isotopes; Methane; Molecules; Natural gas; Natural gasoline plants; Shale; Surface reactions; Temperature programmed desorption; Transmission electron microscopy; Bimetallic catalysts; Bio oil; Catalyst stability; Isotopic labeling; Methane coupling; Natural gas utilization; Bismuth alloys; Activated Carbon; Alcohols; Catalysts; Isotopes; Methane",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057579657

In contrast, dehydration of xylose, one of the main constituents of hemicelluloses, yields furfural. The dehydration process is relatively simple, and furfural has several applications mainly in the polymer and lubricant industries. Moreover, chemical upgrade of furfural can yield 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (MTHF) and ethyl levulinate (EL), two chemicals that can be used as fuel additives in gasoline and diesel, respectively. In this work, three chemical upgrading routes for furfural were proposed and simulated based on process data available in the literature. The economic analysis showed the feasibility of producing MTHF in a two-step hydrogenation process, in four geographic regions (Brazil, China, European Union, and the United States). The maximum furfural price to allow profits at a minimum acceptable rate of return of 10% is $457 Mg−1. On the other hand, the conversion of furfural to ethyl levulinate is not economically attractive mainly because of its lower energy density, which resulted in a low selling price. This study also discussed the need for new catalysts to avoid high hydrogen to furfural ratios while enabling hydrogenation at high pressures.

The most widely used feedstocks for biodiesel production are vegetable oils. In this work, biodiesel production from castor oil has been synthesized by homogenous alkaline transesterification. The influence of catalyst concentration, methanol:oil molar ratio, reaction temperature and reaction time in the methyl ester content reached by castor oil transesterification have been evaluated. A yield of 95 wt% biodiesel was achieved at 1 wt% KOH, 60 °C, 9:1 methanol:oil ratio and 30 min reaction time. Transesterification at temperature 30 °C gave a yield compatibles with that obtained at 60 °C. The composition of the fatty acid methyl ester was determined by Gas Chromatography. The castor oil biodiesel produced was blended with different concentrations of petrodiesel to obtain B5, B10 and B20. The biodiesel properties and its blends were determined according to the standard test methods of analysis. The results showed that Castor oil biodiesel in the blends could lower the cloud point value, but simultaneously, increases the viscosity of the diesel–biodiesel blends. Thus, castor oil biodiesel with its very low cloud and pour points is suitable for using in extreme winter temperatures. © 2018 Egyptian Petroleum Research Institute","Biodiesel fuel; Biodiesel properties; Castor oil; Gas chromatography; Transesterification",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046704911

TiO2 supported highly dispersed nanometric-size metallic Ru catalysts were prepared at room temperature via a solar light induced photon-assisted one-step synthesis in liquid phase, far smaller Ru nanoparticles with sharper size distribution being synthesized when compared to the catalysts that were prepared by impregnation with thermal reduction in hydrogen. The underlying strategy is based on the redox photoactivity of the TiO2 semi-conductor support under solar light for allowing the reduction of metal ions pre-adsorbed at the host surface by photogenerated electrons from the conduction band of the semi-conductor in order to get a fine control in terms of size distribution and dispersion, with no need of chemical reductant, final thermal treatment, or external hydrogen. Whether acetylacetonate or chloride was used as precursor, 0.6 nm sub-nanometric metallic Ru particles were synthesized on TiO2 with a sharp size distribution at a low loading of 0.5 wt.%. Using the chloride precursor was necessary for preparing Ru/TiO2 catalysts with a 0.8 nm sub-nanometric mean particle size at 5 wt.% loading, achieved in basic conditions for benefitting from the enhanced adsorption between the positively-charged chloro-complexes and the negatively-charged TiO2 surface. Remarkably, within the 0.5-5 wt.% range, the Ru content had only a slight influence on the sub-nanometric particle size distribution, thanks to the implementation of suitable photo-assisted synthesis conditions. We demonstrated further that a fine control of the metal Ru nanoparticle size on the TiO2 support was possible via a controlled nanocluster growth under irradiation, while the nanoparticles revealed a good resistance to thermal sintering. © 2018 by the authors.","Catalyst preparation; Highly dispersed Ru nanoparticle; Photodeposition; Photon-assisted synthesis; Reaction mechanism; Ru/TiO2 catalyst; Sub-nanometric particle size distribution","Chlorine compounds; Fuel additives; Light transmission; Metal ions; Metal nanoparticles; Nanostructured materials; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Photons; Ruthenium; Sintering; Size distribution; Solar power generation; Synthesis (chemical); Titanium dioxide; Catalyst preparation; Photo-deposition; Reaction mechanism; Ru nanoparticles; Ru/TiO2; Nanocatalysts",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056755334

In this study, various Ni based catalysts were studied for the LA hydrogenation with formic acid (FA) used as a hydrogen source. Two different ways of catalytic activity improvement are discussed (nickel loading vs addition of dopants). The influence of Ni doping by small amount of noble metals (Pt, Pd, Ru, Rh) showed that Ni-Pd is the most active catalyst. Its high catalytic performance is attributed to the synergic effect between two metals and interaction with chlorine. The effect of chlorine on catalytic performance and properties of the catalysts was evaluated by variety of surface and bulk-sensitive characterization methods. It was shown that addition of chlorine is one of the key factors required for high catalytic performance. Chlorine influences distribution of metals on the surface of the catalyst, their interaction with support and facilitates the formation of small crystallites, which is beneficial for reaching high catalytic activity.

Emulsification is a physical upgrading technology, which blends immiscible liquids into a homogeneous emulsion through the addition of an emulsifier. Liquefaction bio-oil from food waste is characterized by its high pour point when compared to diesel fuel. In order to partially replace diesel fuel by liquefaction bio-oil, this study aimed to develop a method to simultaneously extract and emulsify the bio-oil using a commercial surfactant (Atlox 4914, CRODA, Snaith, UK). The solubility and stability of the emulsions at various operating conditions such as the bio-oil-to-emulsifier ratio (B/E ratio), storage temperature and duration, and co-surfactant (methanol) addition were analyzed. The results demonstrate that higher amounts of bio-oil (7 g) and emulsifier (7 g) at a B/E ratio = 1 in an emulsion have a higher solubility (66.48 wt %). When the B/E ratio was decreased from 1 to 0.556, the bio-oil solubility was enhanced by 45.79%, even though the storage duration was up to 7 days. Compared to the emulsion stored at room temperature (25 °C), its storage at 100 °C presented a higher solubility, especially at higher B/E ratios. Moreover, when methanol was added as a co-surfactant during emulsification at higher B/E ratios (0.714 to 1), it rendered better solubility (58.83-70.96 wt %). Overall, the emulsified oil showed greater stability after the extraction-emulsification process. © 2018 by the authors.

However, simple separation of these catalysts from product mixtures is a problem of the process. In this study, series of magnetic KOH/Fe3O4@Al2O3 core–shell nanocatalysts were synthesized via the incipient wetness impregnation method and the effect of weight ratio of Fe3O4-to-Al2O3 (0.15–0.35) on the catalytic performance was assessed. The samples were characterized by XRD, FTIR, BET-BJH, VSM, SEM, TEM, and EDX analyses and their basicity was measured by the Hammett indicator method. The results revealed that although the magnetic KOH/Fe3O4@Al2O3 nanocatalyst with 25 wt% of Fe3O4 showed less activity as compared to those with 15 wt% of Fe3O4, it exhibited higher surface area and appropriate magnetic properties. The sample presented superparamagnetic properties with the magnetic strength of 1.25 emu/g that was simply recovered by using an external magnetic field.

The derived bio-oil was analyzed by FTIR and GC-MS, FTIR and XRD were used to characterize Mulberry bark and the solid residues. The results showed that liquefaction efficiency of Mulberry bark was higher in S-C-E-W (95.72 wt %) than that in S-C-W (87.5 wt%), and the bio-oil yield was a little more in S-C-E-W (30.32 wt %) than that in S-C-W (28.81 wt%), although the yield of the heavy oil (HO) varied little (26.16% in S-C-E-W, 26.25% in S-C-W), and the yield of the light oil (LO) was very low (4.16% in S-C-E-W and 2.56% in S-C-W). There was small difference between the higher heating values. The bio-oil components were complex, mainly contained phenols, aromatic, alkanes, ketone, esters, furans, nitrogen compounds, etc. The content of phenols in the bio-oil derived in S-C-W was more than that derived in S-C-E-W, and HO derived in S-C-E-W contained higher content of ester components.

It is necessary to develop new technologies for the use of this by-product, adding value to the biodiesel production chain. In this work we investigated glycerol oxidation under mild reaction conditions (air as oxidizing agent and base-free medium) promoted by suitable catalysts. We prepared mono- and bimetallic catalysts of platinum, copper and nickel in the form of nanoparticles by conventional heating and by an alternative method using microwave heating. The nanoparticles were dispersed in activated carbon and tested in glycerol oxidation aiming its valorization into molecules with high added value. Copper and nickel monometallic materials were not active in glycerol oxidation. Platinum monometallic and platinum–copper and platinum–nickel bimetallic materials showed catalytic activity, with platinum–nickel prepared by microwave heating being the most active material in reactions tested. This catalyst presented glycerol conversion of approximately 20% with a turnover number of 9465 in a reaction time of 6 h and 58% of selectivity to glyceric acid, the main product obtained. The best performance of platinum–nickel prepared by microwave heating catalyst was attributed to the probable formation of a metallic alloy between Pt and Ni, as evidenced by the decrease in the lattice parameter for PtNi bimetallic nanoparticles. The results showed that it was possible to obtain an active catalyst in glycerol oxidation reaction under mild conditions via a simple methodology using microwave heating, which demands 94% less time in comparison with conventional heating. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Activated carbon; Bimetallic catalyst; Glyceric acid; Glycerol oxidation; Microwave heating; PtNi nanoparticles","Activated carbon; Binary alloys; Biodiesel; Catalyst activity; Copper; Glycerol; Microwave heating; Microwaves; Nanoparticles; Nickel; Oxidation; Platinum; Platinum alloys; Bimetallic catalysts; Bimetallic nanoparticles; Biodiesel production; Glyceric acid; Glycerol conversions; Glycerol oxidation; Microwave-polyol method; Mild reaction conditions; Catalyst selectivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051708078

The feasibility in commercial scale microalgae cultivation could be enhanced by incorporating palm oil mill effluent (POME) as culture medium, for greater biomass growth and lipid production, together with POME bioremediation. The polluting POME is generated massively in Malaysia. POME contains high concentrations of carbon and nutrients, thus it is suitable to be applied for microalgae cultivation. The approach on waste to energy should be advanced. We studied the effects of applying Pseudomonas sp. on Chlorella sorokiniana CY-1 cultivation in POME. Pseudomonas sp. was found effective in POME decolourisation prior to C. sorokiniana CY-1 cultivation. Yet, microalgae biomass and lipid productions were higher in the non-decolourised POME. Pseudomonas sp. was as well-being co-cultivated with C. sorokiniana CY-1 in ratios of microalgae versus bacteria of 1:1; 2:1 and 1:2. Biomass of 2.04 g L−1 and biomass productivity of 185.71 mg L−1 d−1 were attained in ratio of 1:1. Interestingly, the lipid content exhibited was excellent (16.04%), and about twofold higher than other ratios and the control (without bacteria). Fatty acids compositions were dominated by C16:0 (32.49%), C18:1 (24.06%) and C18:2 (20.28%), which were desirable fatty acids for biodiesel production. Effective POME bioremediation achieved with chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen and total phosphorus removal of 53.7, 55.6 and 77.3%, respectively. Co-cultivation of microalgae and bacteria can be applied in the POME treatment plant. This allows satisfactory biomass and excellent lipid yields for biofuel production, as well as effective wastewater bioremediation. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Bacteria; Microalgae; Pollutants remediation; Wastewater","Algae; Bacteria; Biodiesel; Biomass; Bioremediation; Biotechnology; Chemical oxygen demand; Effluents; Nitrogen removal; Palm oil; Petroleum industry; Wastewater; Biodiesel production; Biofuel production; Biomass productivity; Chlorella sorokiniana; Micro-algae; Microalgae cultivation; Palm oil mill effluents; Waste water bioremediation; Fatty acids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042229576

As a result, the optimal reaction temperature is 100 °C, the EMF yield monotonically increases with prolonging the reaction time from 3 to 24 h, the optimal fructose concentration is 0.5 mmol, and the EMF yield gradually increases with increasing the adding amount of the catalyst from 50 to 150 mg. In addition, the as-prepared catalysts exhibit considerably high stability in the current EMF synthesis system, and they can maintain a similar level of reactivity after four catalytic cycles. © 2018 Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences","5-Ethoxymethylfurfural; Annealing; Fructose; Hydrothermal carbonization; Sulfonation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060351767

However, development of efficient solid acidic catalysts which perform stably for this process is still challenging. Herein, we reported a novel carbon-based solid acidic catalyst, prepared via hydrothermal carbonization of glucose followed by magnetization of Fe3O4 and sulfonation of H2SO4, which can serve as an efficient and recyclable catalyst in the catalytic dehydration of fructose to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and subsequent etherification of 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF) with ethanol from various carbohydrates. The effects of reaction conditions (temperature, time, solvents, catalyst amount, and γ-valerolactone (GVL) concentration) were optimized affording to a maximum EMF yield of 67.4 % at 120 °C, 55 wt % catalyst loading based on starting fructose and 60 vol.% of GVL in ethanol after 24 h of reaction. Noticeably, GVL promotes the formation of EMF and HMF reducing the extent of side reactions. Recycling experiments showed that the catalyst could be easily separated with a magnet and reused up to 4 consecutive times without significant loss of activity. The present work opens a way to synthesize reusable and cost-effective solid acidic catalysts from biomass wastes and may contribute to a holistic approach for biomass valorization. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The mechanistic reaction pathways, like hydro-deoxygenation, decarboxylation and hydrocracking, of the selected palmitic acid, as a model fatty acid, over Ni/ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts were studied. The ZSM-5 material with different Al/Si molar ratios was synthesized via a green template-free hydrothermal synthesis procedure, treated and subsequent functionalised with various Ni metal loadings. However, Ni/Al molar ratio was kept stoichiometric (Ni/Al = 0.5). The characteristic physicochemical properties of composite catalysts were studied by numerous characterization techniques, such as X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning-, as well as high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (SEM/HRTEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). NiO with an average particle size of 10–20 nm was found on ZSM-5 support. The relative Ni/Al atom fraction in Ni/ZSM-5 systems influenced their Lewis/Brønsted acidic sites, as well as the external exposed area of prepared heterogeneous structures. Furthermore, the mentioned morphological parameters affected predominant catalytic routes. Species’ production mechanism, as a consequence of Lewis/Brønsted centre weak/strong acidity, as well as their integral concentration, was proposed, mirroring the observed process kinetics, selectivity and turnover. It was demonstrated that the main obtained products were esters, aldehydes, alcohols, hydrocarbons and gases (CO2, CO…), produced by deoxygenation (e.g. decarbonylation), hydrogenation and cracking, less, though, through isomerisation. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Bifunctional Ni/ZSM-5 catalyst; Cracking with deoxygenation; Palmitic acid model compound; Reaction pathway mechanism; Stoichiometric Ni/Al molar ratio; Waste edible oil","Carboxylation; Catalysts; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Hydrocracking; Hydrothermal synthesis; Nickel oxide; Particle size; Saturated fatty acids; Scanning electron microscopy; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; X ray powder diffraction; Zeolites; Bi-functional; Deoxygenations; Model compound; Molar ratio; Reaction pathways; Waste edible oil; Palmitic acid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052843031

In this study, wheat straw was used as a candidate lignocellulosic biomass to produce hydrogen fuel through hydrothermal gasification. The fluid phases of water investigated for gasification included subcritical (300 and 370°C) and supercritical (450 and 550°C) phases. Along with the effects of temperature (300-550°C), the influences of feed concentration (20-35 wt%) and reaction time (40-70 minutes) were comprehensively studied for wheat straw gasification in subcritical and supercritical water. To maximize hydrogen and total gas yields, the effects of two metal catalysts (eg, Ru/Al2O3 and Ni/Si-Al2O3) were examined. Hydrogen and total gas yields, as well as lower heating values of the gas products, were comparatively evaluated during the subcritical and supercritical water gasification of wheat straw. Supercritical water gasification of wheat straw at 550°C with 20 wt% feed concentration for 60 minutes of reaction time resulted in higher yields of hydrogen (2.98 mmol/g) and total gases (10.6 mmol/g). When compared to noncatalytic gasification, catalytic gasification using 5 wt% loading of Ru/Al2O3 and Ni/Si-Al2O3 enhanced the hydrogen yields up to 4.18 and 5.1 mmol/g, respectively, along with respective total gas yields of 15 and 18.2 mmol/g. Nonetheless, wheat straw-derived biochar produced at high supercritical water temperatures also retained high carbon content and calorific value. © 2018 The Authors.

Our main objective in the present research was to produce H2-rich gas from the wastes of dairy cattle in the presence of the efficient catalyst supported on a support that was prepared from the cattle feed. Therefore, with the aim of improving one of the momentous dimensions in the sustainable development that is the environmental protection, considerable efforts were focused on the maximum exploration of dairy cattle waste materials. Three operating parameters of temperature (380–440 °C), reaction time (5–30 min), and feed concentration (2.5–3.5 wt%) were examined and their optimized levels were found to be 440 °C, 20 min, and 2.5 wt%, respectively. The hydrothermal gasification was performed using Ni catalyst supported on activated carbon canola stalks (ACCs), CM hydrochar that was produced via the HTC and further ZnCl2 chemical activation of canola stalks, and the combination of ACCS and hydrochar (called blend) catalysts under the optimized conditions. The impact of catalyst supports on the distribution of gaseous products was assessed by various techniques and accordingly, the blend catalyst increased the H2 and total gas yields by the factors of 1.73 and 1.66, respectively. Furthermore, the bio-oil of the HTG process was also collected and analyzed using GC/MS analysis and it was found that the CM bio-oil is rich in phenol and its derivatives, furans, Nitrogen-containing compounds, and aromatic molecular structures. © 2018","Activated carbon; Cattle manure; Hydrochar; Hydrothermal carbonization; Hydrothermal gasification","Activated carbon; Aromatic compounds; Biofuels; Blending; Carbonization; Chemical activation; Chlorine compounds; Chromatographic analysis; Environmental protection; Fertilizers; Gasification; Hydrogen production; Manures; Nickel; Petroleum prospecting; Sustainable development; Thermochemistry; Zinc chloride; Carbonaceous catalyst; Cattle manures; Hydrochar; Hydrothermal carbonization; Hydrothermal carbons; Hydrothermal gasification; Operating parameters; Optimized conditions; Catalyst supports",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050239352

A systematic study on effect of different parameters on reaction rate and selectivity was undertaken. Ethyl levulinate (EL) is also formed due to a parallel reaction of D-fructose with ethanol and water generated in-situ coupled with a consecutive reaction of ethanol with EMF. The formation of EL, which is also a fuel additive, was controlled by using lower temperature. DESs are highly reusable and show good activity up to four cycles.

To select the most appropriate strain for biodiesel production, three microalgae species, namely Isochrysis sp., Nannochloropsis maritima and Tetraselmis sp., isolated from Tunisian coast, were biochemically characterized. Initially, gas chromatography analysis showed that Isochrysis sp. and N. maritima contained 5- and 10-fold total fatty acids, respectively, more than Tetraselmis sp. Then, the two microalgae Isochrysis sp. and N. maritima were subject to random mutagenesis using ultraviolet-C radiation. Subsequently, a total of 18 mutants were obtained from both species. The neutral lipid evaluation on said 18 mutants allowed the retention of only 7 to further fatty acid characterization. Finally, gas chromatography revealed that the mutant 5c Isochrysis sp. was characterized by a high level of saturated fatty acids (52.3%), higher amount of monounsaturated fatty acids (29.3%), lower level of polyunsaturated fatty acids (18.4%) and a significant 1.3-fold increase in its C16–C18 content compared to the wild-type strain, which would make it an interesting candidate for biofuel production. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Biodiesels; Fatty acids; Flow cytometry; Strain selection","Algae; Fatty acids; Flow cytometry; Gas chromatography; Microorganisms; Monounsaturated fatty acids; Polyunsaturated fatty acids; Saturated fatty acids; Biodiesel production; Biofuel production; Gas chromatography analysis; Random mutagenesis; Strain selection; Third generation; Tunisian coast; Wild-type strain; Biodiesel; arachidonic acid; biodiesel; docosahexaenoic acid; fatty acid; linolenic acid; lipid; monounsaturated fatty acid; myristic acid; oleic acid; palmitic acid; palmitoleic acid; polyunsaturated fatty acid; saturated fatty acid; biofuel; algal growth; biofuel production; cell density; DNA repair; fatty acid analysis; flow cytometry; gas chromatography; Isochrysis; lipid composition; lipid storage; lipogenesis; microalga; mutagenesis; Nannochloropsis; Nannochloropsis maritima; nonhuman; priority journal; Tetraselmis; Tunisian; ultraviolet C radiation; biosynthesis; chemistry; growth, development and aging; Haptophyta; isolation and purification; lipid metabolism; microbiology; Tunisia; Biofuels; Haptophyta; Lipid Metabolism; Lipids; Microalgae; Tunisia; Water Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049075040

HTL is one of the thermochemical processes for bio-oil production. However, the high pressure of the process is one of the main challenges for commercialization. On the other hand, a decrease in the HTL pressure, and consequently a decrease in the temperature, results in a decrease in the bio-oil yield. In this work, we investigated a new method to increase the bio-oil yield at low pressures and temperatures. The microalgae (Nannochloropsis sp.) were first pretreated by ultrasonic waves for 30, 60, and 90 s at 100 W. After then, the bio-oil was produced using HTL at 210, 230, and 250 °C. According to the results, using ultrasonic-assisted HTL increased the bio-oil yield up to the maximum of 28.9% (90-s sonication time at 250 °C). Moreover, applying ultrasonic pretreatment resulted in a decrease in oxygen content of the bio-oil and consequently an increase in its heating value. However, the average nitrogen content did not change dramatically by using ultrasonic-assisted hydrothermal liquefaction. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Bio-oil; Energy efficiency; Hydrothermal liquefaction; Microalgae; Sonication","Algae; Energy efficiency; Liquefaction; Microorganisms; Sonication; Temperature; Bio oil; Hydrothermal liquefactions; Low temperatures; Micro-algae; Nannochloropsis sp; Nitrogen content; Thermo chemical process; Ultrasonic pretreatment; Biofuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051197325

Proper treatment of sludge needs huge investment and proper handling. To address this issue, the immobilized photocatalyst (TiO2) mediated exocellular fractionation of bacterial pretreatment for anaerobic digestion was utilized as a sludge treatment technique. RESULT: Ti was deposited on glass substrate by a DC spluttering technique, and a TiO2 layer was formed by annealing in oxygen atmosphere. This immobilized TiO2 efficiently extricated the extracellular components after 45 min by removing 99% of the total extractable extracellular polymeric substances. The exocellular fractionated bacterial pretreatment induced 20% of COD solubilization with methane generation of about 0.0217 g COD g-1 COD d-1, which was higher than the sludge without any treatment and sludge with bacterial pretreatment only. CONCLUSION: An 8% increase in COD solubilization was achieved, which generated high quantities of methane. With the advantage of methane generation, the maximum profitable sludge reduction was obtained. Thin film deposition of TiO2 enables easy recovery of TiO2.

Although nanotechnology has been promising in offering huge developments in various fields, there are still concerns about the potential threats of nanotechnology products and applications. The concerns are mostly about the possible entrance of nanoparticles into body and their toxicity. As metallic and metal oxide nanoparticles might have toxic effects on living organisms, the use of biocompatible nanoparticles can considerably reduce these concerns. In this research, a combination of diesel-biodiesel-water-biodegradable nanoparticles was used to optimize fuel consumption, reduce pollutants, and enhance diesel engine performance for first time. Carbon quantum dot nanoparticles were synthesized through the hydrothermal method using orange peel and were then characterized thoroughly. Water and quantum dot nanoparticles were added to the B15 fuel (diesel fuel containing 15% biodiesel) in various concentrations. Then, engine performance experiments were performed using a single cylinder engine to investigate functional parameters and assess exhaust pollutants. The obtained results showed that the addition of water and quantum dot nanoparticles to the B15 fuel causes an increase in engine torque and power and decreases the brake specific fuel consumption. This is due to the better mixing of the fuel and air in combustion chamber and provision of more oxygen. It was also revealed that the use of emulsion nanofuels decreases the emission of unburned hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides (NOx).

To accomplish this, we developed an integrated strategy that combines homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions with a treatment-extraction step to coproduce 2-methylfuran (MF) and 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) directly from hardwood poplar while maintaining high catalyst activity. In the first step, poplar wood chips were treated with dilute FeCl3 in THF-water at subpyrolytic temperature to yield 93.5% furfural (FF) from xylan and 66.0% 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) from glucan. Concurrently, a highly pure lignin powder was obtained from the liquor by precipitation upon room temperature vacuum recovery of THF from the water. Afterward, FF and HMF were extracted from water into an organic phase consisting of toluene and 1,4-dioxane treated with Ca(OH)2. A second hydrodeoxygenation reaction using Cu-Ni/TiO2 catalyst yielded 87.8% MF from FF and 85.6% DMF from HMF. Characterization of the lignin product showed its molecular weight to be reduced by an order of magnitude from its native state as well as complete removal of its native β-aryl ether linkages without hydrogen input or further heterogeneous catalytic processing. A 60% cumulative yield of MF, DMF, and lignin products from the available carbon (xylan+glucan+lignin) in poplar was achieved, rivaling more mature cellulosic ethanol strategies.

In this study, microwave irradiation was utilized to produce a novel KOH/Ca12Al14O33 nanocatalyst used for biodiesel production. As support, calcium aluminate was prepared by microwave combustion method using different fuels including urea, glycine, sorbitol, and citric acid. The samples were then impregnated by KOH to improve their catalytic activities for microwave-enhanced transesterification of canola oil for biodiesel production. Results of XRD, BET, FTIR, TG, EDX, and FE-SEM analyses showed differences in physicochemical properties of the samples when using different fuels with different flame characteristics and combustion temperatures. Only the urea-fueled sample showed the crystalline structure of monocalcium aluminate (CaAl2O4), with the other samples exhibiting amorphous structure of CaO–Al2O3. However, all samples, except for that prepared by citric acid, transformed to crystalline structure of Ca12Al14O33 by calcination during KOH impregnation. Among the samples, the KOH/Ca12Al14O33 nanocatalyst prepared by sorbitol showed the highest activity in microwave-enhanced biodiesel production because of its large surface area, pore size, and basicity, converting 93.4% of canola oil to biodiesel at a methanol-to-oil molar ratio of 18, catalyst concentration of 4 wt%, and microwave output power of 450 W in 60 min of reaction time. Moreover, the sample showed well-distributed particle sizes without any agglomeration, so that it could easily maintain its level of activity for several rounds of use. © 2017, Islamic Azad University (IAU).","Biodiesel; Calcium aluminate; Combustion method; Microwave irradiation; Solid base catalyst","Alcohols; Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Amino acids; Biodiesel; Catalyst activity; Citric acid; Combustion; Crystalline materials; Irradiation; Metabolism; Nanocatalysts; Pore size; Potassium hydroxide; Sodium Aluminate; Urea; Calcium aluminate; Catalyst concentration; Combustion method; Combustion temperatures; Flame characteristics; Microwave output power; Physicochemical property; Solid base catalysts; Microwave irradiation; aluminum compound; biofuel; calcium; catalyst; combustion; diesel; fuel; hydroxide; irradiation; microwave radiation; oil production; potassium; temperature; Brassica napus var. napus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049786305

In this study, to improve biodiesel production process efficiency by acids, biodiesel production were successfully developed using a series of magnetically acidic poly(ionic liquid) catalysts with varying hydrophobicity and controllable acidity. The detailed characterization results demonstrated that the FnmS-PIL (1a, C8) core-shell structure catalyst had large Bruner Emmett and Teller (BET) surface area (128.1 m2/g), uniform mesoporous structure (4.2 nm), strong magnetism (12.4 emu/g), a high number of acid sites (2.14 mmol/g), strong acid strength (strong electron-withdrawing anion CF3SO3 − effect, −8.2 &lt; H0 &lt; −5.6) and strong hydrophobicity (water contact angle, 115.4°). For the biodiesel production, high biodiesel yields could be achieved by the esterification of oleic acid (by response surface methodology, RSM) and (trans)esterification of crude Euphorbia lathyris L. oils with an acid value of 24.59 mg KOH/g (by single factor optimization). Furthermore, a relative kinetic study was conducted wherein the activation energy was calculated as 39.2 kJ/mol and a pseudo-first-order model was determined for esterification. More importantly, the FnmS-PIL (1a, C8) catalyst was separated simply using a magnet and exhibited constant activity with biodiesel yield of 87.5% after five cycles in (trans)esterification. In addition, the biodiesel yield was maintained above 90% even with a water content of 6 wt% with respect to crude Euphorbia lathyris L. oils, and the fuel properties of Euphorbia lathyris L. biodiesel were found to satisfy the EN 14212 and ASTM D6751 standards, highlighting its potential in industrial biodiesel production as derived from crude non-food oil resources. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","(Trans)esterification; Biodiesel; Hydrophobicity; Kinetic study; Magnetically acidic polymeric ionic liquids","Activation energy; Catalysts; Esterification; Esters; Fuel oils; Hydrophobicity; Ionic liquids; Kinetic theory; Oils and fats; Polymers; Potassium hydroxide; Electron-withdrawing anions; Esterification of oleic acids; Heterogeneous catalyst; Kinetic study; Petroleum-derived fuels; Polymeric ionic liquids; Response surface methodology; Uniform mesoporous structure; Biodiesel; biofuel; biological production; catalyst; chemical reaction; hydrophobicity; ionic liquid; magnetic method; polymer; reaction kinetics; recycling; Euphorbia lathyris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046692740

In this work, we succeed in using Salicornia Bigelovii (halophyte plant) as a raw material for bioethanol production. The characterization studies indicate a biomass composition comparable to traditional lignocellulosic biomasses: about 46.22 ± 1.20 of cellulose, 14.93 ± 0.37 of hemicellulose and, a low lignin content (1.96 ± 0.21). The highest cellulose content (75.4%) without the presence of furfural aldehyde is obtained employing the wet oxidation pretreatment method, it is performed at 200 °C with test cycles of 10 min applying 1.0 MPa of oxygen pressure. The enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose is improved employing a dilute-acid hydrolysis after the pretreatment cycle, reaching an overall glucose yield of 91%. Moreover, inhibition of cellulose enzymatic conversion by filtrates is not observed during this process. The simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (employing Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast for 120 h) of the pretreated material (using wet oxidation followed by dilute-acid hydrolysis), shows a higher ethanol production yield of 98%. These results demonstrate that there is no need of additional nutrients for the fermentation of Salicornia Bigelovii hydrolysates.

It is a renewable source of energy, prepared from triacylglycerides, which are contained in vegetable oils and animal fats. This work focuses on alkaline catalyzed transesterification of rapeseed oil with butanol and comparison of two catalysts (potassium hydroxide and potassium tert-butoxide). In industry is usually transesterification of rapeseed oil carried out like reaction catalyzed by potassium hydroxide. Potassium hydroxide have high content of K2CO3, KHCO3 and water. Moreover water is formed by neutralization of potassium hydroxide with free fatty acids contained in oil. In cause of tert-butoxide catalyzed reaction, it is not possible because tert-butoxide have not a OH− aniont, which is needed for water forming. The influence of various conditions (addition of water, temperature of separation, intensity of stirring and type of catalyst) on butanolysis process was studied for both catalysts. For both catalysts dependence of conversions on time were plotted. When tert-butoxide was used, satisfactory phase separation was not achieved. The only way was separation of hot crude reaction mixture without adding water. Ester formed by this method had high content of free glycerol and soaps, but reached higher conversion. The best results were obtained with KOH and subsequent separation of cold crude reaction mixture with the addition of water and slow stirring.

The particle sizes were 11.5 ± 4 and 9.5 ± 4 nm for the nanoparticles prepared at 80 °C and 25 °C, respectively. The adsorption of polyethyleneimine (PEI) onto Fe3O4 was studied by equilibrium batch measurements. A mono-layer absorption of PEI was found. The Fe3O4–PEI nanocomposites had a positive zeta potential, which decreased with increasing pH of the solution. The nanocomposites were used for magnetic harvesting of negatively charged Chlorella zofingiensis, Chlorella vulgaris, Chlorella sorokiniana, Chlorella ellipsoidea and Botryococcus braunii microalgae strains. Upon dosage of 200 mg/L of Fe3O4–PEI harvesting efficiencies of 68–97% were achieved at pH 4 within 1 min. The harvesting efficiency decreased with increasing pH of the suspension.

This catalyst was used in biodiesel production reaction from vegetable oil. By changing the fuel to nitrates ratio, proper structure of catalyst was obtained to produce biodiesel. Physiochemical analysis including XRD, FESEM, EDX dot-mapping, BET-BJH, FTIR and Surface Particle Size Distribution (SPSD) were used to define the characteristics of synthesized catalysts and optimum fuel ratio in combustion synthesis method. To evaluate the performance of the synthesized nanoceramics, all samples were used in the biodiesel production reaction. The results of XRD analyses showed the successful synthesis of MgFe2O4 crystals and also determined that other materials peaks (iron oxide phases) does not exist in the catalyst structure. BET-BJH analyses reveal the structures with large pore (more than 10 nm) and relatively good surface area (97.8 m2/g) for synthesized catalysts by combustion method. By biodiesel production reaction in the conditions of temperature = 110 °C, methanol-to-oil molar ratio = 12, catalyst concentration = 4 wt.% and reaction time = 4 h, it was found that the catalyst has great potential to produce biodiesel and also maximum conversion of 91.2% was obtained. For the stability test of catalyst, after convenient catalyst separation by magnet, it was used for five consecutive transesterification reactions that the results were very acceptable and finally the lowest conversion was achieved to be 82.4%. By the simultaneous consideration of analyses and reactor tests results, it was found that synthesized catalyst with fuel ratio of 1.5 has the best performance and it is very suitable for biodiesel production reaction. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Biodiesel; Combustion synthesis; Fuel ratio; MgO/MgFe2O4; Nanocatalyst; Sunflower oil","Biodiesel; Combustion synthesis; Crystal structure; Iron oxides; Magnesia; Nanocatalysts; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Sunflower oil; Biodiesel production; Catalyst concentration; Catalyst structures; Catalytic properties; Combustion synthesis method; Fuel ratio; Nano-catalyst; Transesterification reaction; Synthetic fuels; biofuel; catalysis; catalyst; ceramics; combustion; nanoparticle; particle size; performance assessment; physicochemical property; size distribution; Helianthus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043573916

Along this background, the production of furan-based chemicals from lignocellulose becomes one of the research focuses in biorefinery. Furfural is the key furan-based building block, which is manufactured from hemicellulose fraction directly, and offers a promising, rich platform for lignocellulosic biofuels and value-added chemicals. So it is of great practical significance to develop green technologies for the production of furfural and the conversion of furfural to primary furan-based chemicals. In this review, the formation routes and catalytic conversion of hemicellulose into furfural were summarized with special attentions on the heterogeneous acid-catalysts for the production of furfural in the liquid phase, including zeolites, metal oxides, ion-exchange resins, clays and carbon materials. The formation routes and technologies starting from furfural to various furan-based chemicals, including furfuryl alcohol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, 2-methylfuran, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, furan, tetrahydrofuran, were reviewed. © 2018, Editorial Board of «Chemistry and Industry of Forest Products».

Catalyst tests were carried out in a continuous fixed bed reactor at atmospheric pressure and steam to carbon (S/C) ratio of 5.0. In the case of experiments with the bio-oil/bio-glycerol mixture the initial temperature was 1073 K, then it was successively changed to 973 K and 1073 K again to assess catalyst deactivation. Experiments with the bio-oil sample were run at 1073 K. First, the effect of modifications to the alumina support with CeO2 and La2O3 was studied in monometallic catalysts. Ni/CeO2–Al2O3 was identified as the catalyst more resistant to deactivation, likely due to its higher oxygen mobility, and selected for further tests. Then, bimetallic catalysts were produced by impregnation of noble metals (Pd, Pt or Rh) on the Ni catalyst supported on CeO2–Al2O3. Co-impregnation of Rh and Ni on the CeO2–Al2O3 support represented a further improvement in the catalytic activity and stability respect to the monometallic catalyst, leading to stable gas compositions close to thermodynamic equilibrium due to the favourable Rh–Ni interactions. Rh–Ni/CeO2–Al2O3 is therefore a promising catalyst to produce a hydrogen-rich gas from bio-oil SR. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Bimetallic; Bio-glycerol; Bio-oil; Hydrogen; Monometallic; Steam reforming","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Atmospheric pressure; Biofuels; Catalyst activity; Catalyst deactivation; Cerium oxide; Chemical reactors; Hydrogen; Impregnation; Mixtures; Nickel; Nickel compounds; Steam; Steam reforming; Bimetallic; Bimetallic catalysts; Bio oil; Fixed bed reactor; Initial temperatures; Monometallic; Monometallic catalysts; Thermodynamic equilibria; Catalyst supports",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045097372

Here, convertible production of promising 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) and 2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran (DMTHF) biofuels was achieved successfully via green catalytic transfer hydrogenolysis of biomass-derived 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) using a nitrogen-doped carbon (NC)-decorated copper-based catalyst with cyclohexanol as hydrogen source. DMF or DMTHF with high yield of 96.1% or 94.6% was produced convertibly through simply modulating reaction time. Extensive characterizations revealed that appropriate surface base sites on the catalyst could efficiently promote the activation of alcohol hydroxyl in cyclohexanol and the subsequent release of active hydrogen species, while highly dispersed surface Cu0 nanoparticles and electrophilic Cu+ species were beneficial to the hydrogen transfer and the activation of both the carbonyl group and the hydroxyl group in HMF, respectively. Moreover, as-fabricated NC-decorated Cu-based catalyst presented high stability without obvious loss of catalytic performance after five consecutive cycles, due to the strong interaction between the support and active metal species.

The resultant Ni catalysts improved the performance of the deoxygenation (DO) of triolein at a reaction temperature of 380 °C in a simple glass batch reactor under a solvent-free condition and are hydrogen-free. The incorporation of Ni loading into the HMS framework casued the catalytic activity to increase when compared to that of HMS. Surprisingly, 10 wt% Ni/HMS catalyst exhibited the highest conversion. It was observed that 10 wt% Ni loading was highly dispersed on the HMS which is capable of achieving 92.5% and 95.2% of conversion and selectivity, respectively. This is due to the synergistic effect of Si-O-Ni bonding and high dispersion of NiO on HMS.

Biomass-derived bio-oil is a promising substitute resource because it is renewable, abundant, and carbon-neutral. In this study, three bio-oil models, oleic acid (OA), methyl laurate (ML), and waste cooking oil (WCO), were catalytically cracked over La2O3-modified ZSM-5 (LaZ) aiming for production of light olefins. The content of La2O3 in catalysts was adjusted to optimize the structure and properties of catalysts. The maximal light olefin yield was 131 mL/g for OA, 120 mL/g for ML, and 128 mL/g for WCO, which was obtained over the LaZ catalyst containing 6% La2O3 (6LaZ). The maximal light olefin selectivity was 36.1% for OA, 30.3% for ML, and 33.8% for WCO. The obtained light olefins mainly contained propylene (13.6-17.1%), ethylene (10.7-15.4%), and butene (5.3-6.3%). Aromatic hydrocarbons and graphite were the main components in the liquid product and solid product (coke), respectively. 6LaZ exhibited better catalytic activity and anticoking ability than La-free ZSM-5, which was attributed to its appropriate porosity and acidity. The unsaturated molecular structure of feedstock was found, helping to improve the light olefin yield. Our investigations are useful for developing a new process route to produce light olefins from renewable biomass resources. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",,"Aromatic hydrocarbons; Biofuels; Catalyst activity; Ethylene; Fossil fuel deposits; Fossil fuels; Lanthanum oxides; Oils and fats; Proven reserves; Zeolites; Bio-oil model compounds; Biomass resources; Carbon neutrals; Intensive research; Light olefin selectivities; Liquid products; Structure and properties; Waste cooking oil; Catalytic cracking",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046531568

Economical and effective mass cultivation is essential for greater feasibility in microalgal-based biofuel full applications. The present study reported on cultivation of Chlorella sorokiniana CY-1 in palm oil mill effluent (POME) under photoautotrophic and mixotrophic cultivation. Enhancement of biomass and lipid productions were carried out by using glucose, urea and glycerol supplementations. Mixotrophic cultivation was more effective than photoautotrophic condition. Glycerol addition exhibited greater microalgae growth performance compared to supplementing glucose or urea. Biomass (1.68 g L−1) and lipid (15.07%) production were highest in POME medium with combinations of 200 mg L−1 urea, glucose and glycerol supplementation. Chlorella sorokiniana CY-1 grown in POME with glucose and glycerol supplementation gave considerably comparable yields as in all supplements-added POME medium. Ideal fatty acids compositions shown in urea and glycerol supplemented-POME medium though lower biomass production obtained. The pollutant remediation efficiencies attained were 63.85% COD, 91.54% TN and 83.25% TP in all supplements-added medium. The estimated net energy ratio was 0.55 and nutrient cost could be reduced up to 76%.

The promotion effect of phenol was obviously observed during the hydrogenolysis process, leading to improved bio-oil yield and decreased solid residue yield, due to the unique dissolution and diffusion properties of phenol-containing solvent. The synergistic effects of basic sites and complex solvents were observed; thus, herein, the effect of catalysts, reaction temperature, and time on the hydrogenolysis, repolymerization, and coking on catalysts was investigated in detail, considering the molecular weight, elemental composition, and higher heating value (HHV) of bio-oil.

This study had shed light on the selection of ideal reaction conditions such as temperature (200, 250, 300 °C), pressure (100, 200, 300 bar), and residence time (30, 60 min) for producing maximum bio-crude with/without catalyst aid. In the absence of the catalyst, a bio-crude yield of 35.7% was obtained at 300 °C temperature, 200 bar pressure, and 60 min residence time. On an interesting note, bio-crude yield was increased from 35.7 to 45.1% by adding homogeneous acid catalyst CH3COOH at 300 °C reaction temperature, which was higher than the other acid catalysts HCOOH (40%), H2SO4 (38%), HCl (39%), H3BO3 (37%), and the base catalysts NaOH (38%), KOH (37%), Na2CO3 (40%), K2CO3 (36%), Ca(OH)2 (37%). Elemental analyses of bio-crudes indicated a higher heating value of 35–40 MJ/kg, carbon-74%, nitrogen-5.86%, hydrogen-10.9%, sulfur &lt;0.5 and oxygen content of 8.85%, which is comparable with petro-crude. Using CH3COOH as a catalyst in HTL led to reducing the oxygen content and simultaneously increased the higher heating value of bio-crude. In addition, GC-MS characterization of bio-crude indicated the presence of mono-aromatics, nitrogen heterocycles, phenols, indole and fatty acids. Thus, based on the yield and characteristics, the bio-crude produced from S. obliquus biomass could be used in petroleum refinery for fuel production. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Bio-crude; Biofuel; Catalyst; Elemental composition; Hydrothermal liquefaction; Microalgae","Biofuels; Biomass; Calorific value; Carbon; Catalysts; Crude oil; Fatty acids; Hydrated lime; Liquefaction; Nitrogen; Oxygen; Petroleum industry; Petroleum refineries; Potassium hydroxide; Sodium Carbonate; Sodium hydroxide; Bio-crude; Biochemical composition; Elemental compositions; Higher heating value; Hydrothermal liquefactions; Hydrothermal processing; Micro-algae; Nitrogen heterocycles; Chlorine compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044466012

In this work, a new acid-base bifunctional hybrid BPhZr with augmented average pore diameter was prepared from the assembly of ([1, 1’-biphenyl]-4,4’-diylbis(methylene))diphosphonic acid with zirconium via a facile solvothermal method. The effects of reaction parameters, substrate scope, and metal ion type were investigated. Besides the promotional effect of moderate Lewis acid/base sites and improved texture properties, the presence of Brønsted acidic species (e. g., –OH) in BPhZr was demonstrated to positively promote the synthesis of γ-valerolactone (GVL; ca. 95% yield) from levulinates via cascade transfer hydrogenation and lactonization. In comparison with previously reported catalysts, the BPhZr hybrid exhibited a superior activity in terms of TOF (3.2 h−1) and activation energy (21 kJ/mol) for the reaction. Moreover, BPhZr was found to be highly stable and recyclable in five consecutive cycles, showing no significant decrease in GVL yield and selectivity. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The combustion experiments were conducted under four engine loads in the range of 25–100% of full load condition at a fixed engine speed of 1000 rpm. More specifically, this study was carried out to find the most thermodynamically and economically favorable fuel compositions and engine operating loads. Overall, engine load had a significant effect on the exergoeconomic variables, while fuel type only affected some exergoeconomic parameters. The cost per unit of exergy for the shaft work exergy was considerably decreased by elevating engine load for all the fuel blends investigated. The lowest cost per unit of exergy for the shaft work was determined at 48.81 USD/MJ for neat diesel at full load condition.

The effects of reaction time, temperature, and biomass/water ratio on the yield of bio-oil were assessed. In addition, a balance of carbon and nitrogen among the products (bio-oil, aqueous phase, solid residue, and gas) was carried out, in order to evaluate the quality of the bio-oil and possibilities for increasing value from the byproducts. In a 15-min operation at 300 °C with biomass/water ratio of 1/10 (w.w−1), the bio-oil yield was of 44.4% (Dry Ash Free - daf-basis). Under every condition tested, the solid residue was the most abundant byproduct, mostly due to the high ash content in the biomass. The minimum nitrogen recovery in the bio-oil was 57%, obtained in the operation at 275 °C, which is considered the main disadvantage of the process. The use of biomass directly after its production may result in an excessive consumption of energy due to the high water content. However, the need for drying is reduced when compared to other microalgal-based bioenergy production processes, potentially achieving a positive energy balance in the HTL. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bio-oil; Biorefinery; Hydrothermal liquefaction; Microalga; Thermochemical conversion","Biofuels; Byproducts; Carbon; Lakes; Liquefaction; Nitrogen; Quality control; Sewage; Sewage treatment; Bio oil; Biorefineries; Hydrothermal liquefactions; Microalga; Thermochemical Conversion; Biomass; biomass power; biotransformation; carbon; domestic waste; energy use; hydrothermal alteration; liquefaction; microalga; nitrogen; oil; pond; reaction rate; sewage treatment; temperature; thermochemistry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034860666

The morphology of nanoflower and the distribution and loading of proteins were systematically characterized by scanning electron microscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy and ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy, which indicated the successful encapsulation of lipase in the hybrid nanoflower. Using the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl caprylate as a model, lipase-inorganic hybrid nanoflower was observed to possess favorable catalytic activity and stability in the ester hydrolysis. Further, the hybrid nanoflower was used as a catalyst for biodiesel production, in which it could convert sunflower oil to biodiesel with 96.5% conversion and remain 72.5% conversion after being used for 5 cycles.

Cobalt nanoparticles supported on nitrogen-doped carbon (Co/N-C-600) exhibit high activity and stability for the deoxygenation of vanillin into MMP under mild conditions (150 °C, 10 bar H2). Nearly quantitative MMP yield is obtained in isopropanol after 8 h at 150 °C and 10 bar H2 pressure. According to the distribution of products with time, the deoxygenation of vanillin into MMP mainly proceeds through the hydrogenation of vanillin into vanillyl alcohol and the subsequent hydrogenolysis of vanillyl alcohol into MMP, of which the latter is the rate-determining step, owing to a much higher activation energy. Moreover, after being recycled several times, the loss of catalytic activity is negligible, which demonstrates that the Co/N-C-600 catalyst shows good resistance to deactivation. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Their catalytic performances were systematically evaluated in hydroliquefaction of rice straw. The impact of reaction temperature, reaction time, H2 pressure and Ni/Ce molar ratios on product yields and distribution was also investigated. The conversion (89.08%) of rice straw and bio-oil yield (66.7%) obtained over Ni/CeO2 catalyst with a Ni/Ce molar ratio of 2/10 are superior to those over no catalyst (conversion of 73.65%, bio-oil yield of 47.96%) and pure CeO2 catalyst (conversion of 77.79%, bio-oil yield of 56.67%) under the optimum condition (290 °C, 1.0 h, and 2.0 MPa H2 pressure). GC–MS results show that the main components of bio-oil are phenols, which are high-value-added, important and useful chemicals in transportation and chemical industries. It is worth noting that the highly dispersed Ni nanoparticles and their stronger interaction between Ni and CeO2 with more oxygen vacancies facilitate high conversion of rice straw and bio-oil yield. In addition, a possible catalytic mechanism of Ni/CeO2 catalyst for hydrogenation of rice straw is accordingly proposed.

Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is an attractive technology capable of converting a broad range of organic compounds, especially those with substantial water content, into energy products. The HTL process produces a bio-oil precursor that can be further upgraded to transportation fuels and an aqueous phase containing water-soluble organic impurities. Converting small oxygenated compounds that partition into the water phase into larger, hydrophobic compounds can reduce aqueous phase remediation costs and improve energy yields. HTL was investigated at 300◦C and a reaction time of 1 h for conversion of an institutional food waste to bio-oil, using either homogeneous Na2CO3 or heterogeneous CeZrOx to promote in situ conversion of water-soluble organic compounds into less oxygenated, oil-soluble products. Results with food waste indicate that CeZrOx improves both bio-oil higher heating value (HHV) and energy recovery when compared both to non-catalytic and Na2CO3-catalyzed HTL. The aqueous phase obtained using CeZrOx as an HTL catalyst contained approximately half the total organic carbon compared to that obtained using Na2CO3-suggesting reduced water treatment costs using the heterogeneous catalyst. Experiments with model compounds indicated that the primary mechanism of action was condensation of aldehydes, a reaction which simultaneously increases molecular weight and oxygen-to-carbon ratio-consistent with the improvements in bio-oil yield and HHV observed with institutional food waste. The catalyst was stable under hydrothermal conditions (≥16 h at 300◦C) and could be reused at least three times for conversion of model aldehydes to water insoluble products. Energy and economic analysis suggested favorable performance for the heterogeneous catalyst compared either to non-catalytic HTL or Na2CO3-catalyzed HTL, especially once catalyst lifetime differences were considered. The results of this study establish the potential of heterogeneous catalysts to improve HTL economics and energetics. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

In the present study, deoxygenation (DO) process of triolein was studied by using mesoporous SiO2-Al2O3 supported Co-Ca catalyst. The presence of active metals (Co-Ca) showed high DO activity exclusively via decarboxylation/decarbonylation (deCOx) pathways with maximum hydrocarbon n-(C8-C20) yield of 73%, and high selectivity of n-C15 and n-C17 fractions. This results suggested the acid-base active sites of catalyst provide selective deCOx pathway of triglycerides structure. In additional, the presence of high surface area of Co-Ca/ SiO2-Al2O3 enhance the metal dispersion for better accessment of large molecular reactant with catalyst during DO process. An optimum Co metal content (10 wt.%) for deCOx reaction was observed, while an excess Co content is not preferable due to tendency of cracking effect. The efficiency of Co-Ca/SiO2-Al2O3 was investigated by using non-edible feedstock (e.g. Ceiba oil and Sterculia oil) along with catalyst stability study were carried out.

In order to cope with this crisis, it is necessary to increase the efforts towards production of biofuels such as biological hydrogen (H2). It is well-known fact that the biological hydrogen is a clean and ideal energy and liberates high amount of energy per unit mass. Several groups are working for the large scale production of H2 chemically and also using photosynthetic organisms, but output is not satisfactory. The best way to achieve enhancement of H2 is through altering the photosynthetic process by applying various stress conditions or by natural selection. In the process of selection, Chlorococcum minutum was found with improved H2 output when compared to model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in a massively parallel and competitive high-throughput screen of different green algae. Both the species belongs to class chlorophyceae of green algae and live in fresh water conditions. In extent various light, pH and temperature conditions were applied and achieved the enhancement of H2 production in this species under in vitro settings. Augmented hydrogenase activity was found in Chlorococcum minutum when compared to model alga and this may be one of the reason behind improved H2 output. Hence this species may be considered as one of the best species with respect to H2 production and also this work may be useful for future renewable energy research. © 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Biological hydrogen; Chlorococcum; Enhancement; Green algae; Light; Temperature","Algae; Fossil fuels; Hydrogen production; Image enhancement; Light; Proven reserves; Temperature; Biological hydrogen; Biological hydrogen production; Chlamydomonas reinhardtii; Chlorococcum; Green alga; High-throughput screens; Large scale productions; Photosynthetic organisms; Photobiological hydrogen production",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030549737

However, the surface structure and composition of bimetallic particles can differ significantly from the bulk due to variations in surface energies and interactions with adsorbates, making the design of bimetallic catalysts with targeted properties and reactivities challenging. We report here the influence of catalyst support (Al2O3 and TiO2) on the surface composition and structure of bimetallic Cu-Ni nanoparticles with varying Ni weight loading (0, 0.5, 1.5, 3, 5, and 10 wt %) at a constant Cu loading of 5 wt % and a correlation to catalytic reactivity and stability in furfural (FF) hydrodeoxygenation (HDO). Analysis via depth-profiling X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy suggested that over a range of Ni compositions in Cu-Ni/Al2O3 catalysts, Cu and Ni were distributed evenly within bimetallic particles, although Cu and Ni segregated into contiguous monometallic domains at the particle surfaces. In contrast, on Cu-Ni/TiO2 catalysts near surface alloys formed, which were enriched in Cu at the particle surfaces and exposed only dispersed Ni species. The difference in compositional structure of the Cu-Ni particles on TiO2 and Al2O3 was attributed to strong and specific interactions between Ni and TiO2. On both supports the addition of Ni to Cu catalysts resulted in enhancements in the rate of FF HDO, although Al2O3 supported bimetallic catalysts promoted hydrogenation of the furan ring, forming mostly furfural alcohol and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, while TiO2 supported catalysts mostly resulted in carbonyl hydrogenolysis to form methyl furan (MF). Through optimization of support and bimetallic compositions, low-cost bimetallic catalysts were developed that demonstrated &gt;90% MF yields in FF HDO with good stability and regenerability. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","Bimetallic catalysts; Biofuels; Heterogeneous catalysis; Hydrodeoxygenation; Metal-support interactions","Aldehydes; Aluminum alloys; Aluminum compounds; Aromatic compounds; Binary alloys; Biofuels; Catalysis; Catalyst activity; Catalyst selectivity; Catalysts; Copper alloys; Depth profiling; Furfural; Nickel; Organic pollutants; Stability; Structure (composition); Titanium alloys; Titanium dioxide; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Bimetallic catalysts; Bimetallic compositions; Compositional structure; Hydrodeoxygenation; Metal-support interactions; Monometallic catalysts; Product selectivities; Tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohols; Catalyst supports",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041473281

Due to strong policies, the disposal of this material into nearby sewers causes ecological and environmental problems in many parts of the world. For efficient management, waste cooking oil, a less expensive, alternative and promising feedstock, can be used as a raw material for producing biofuel. In the present study, we produced a biodiesel from hydrolyzed waste cooking oil with a subcritical methanol process using a synthesized solid super acid catalyst, a sulfated zirconium oxide supported on Santa Barbara Amorphous silica (S-ZrO2/SBA-15). The characterization of the synthesized catalyst was carried out using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. The catalytic effect on biodiesel production was examined by varying the parameters: temperatures of 120 to 200 °C, 5-20 min times, oil-to-methanol mole ratios between 1:5 to 1:20, and catalyst loadings of 1-2.5%. The maximum biodiesel yield was 96.383%, obtained under optimum reaction conditions of 140 °C, 10 min, and a 1:10 oil-to-methanol molar ratio with a 2.0% catalyst loading. We successfully reused the catalyst five times without regeneration with a 90% efficiency.

Biodiesel, a renewable liquid transport fuel, is commercially-produced using heterogeneous catalysts. Heterogeneous catalysts obtained from seashells appeared as promising alternatives thanks to their low preparation cost and increased efficiency in transesterification. In this study, shells from Chicoreus brunneus (known as Adusta murex) were calcined, hydrated, and dehydrated to produce CaO heterogeneous nanocatalyst for the transesterification of rice bran oil into biodiesel. Field emission scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, surface area measurement (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method), and X-ray diffraction were used to characterise the seashell-derived catalyst. The properties of the rice bran oil-derived biodiesel (acid value, calorific value, density, oxidation stability, and flash point) conformed to the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) D6751 and European EN 14214 biodiesel standards, except for kinematic viscosity. Therefore, the impact of the parameters used for production of the CaO heterogeneous nanocatalyst (calcination temperature and time) and the transesterification reaction (catalyst loading and methanol to rice bran oil ratio) on the kinematic viscosity of RBO-derived biodiesel were determined. A model for the transesterification process was developed using a combination of artificial neural networking with ant colony optimisation. The model predicted that C. brunneus-derived CaO catalyst prepared at 1100 °C for 72 min could be used to produce biodiesel from rice bran oil with a minimum kinematic viscosity (4.42 mm2 s−1) confirming to both the ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 biodiesel standards in a transesterification reaction operating with a 35:1 methanol to rice bran oil molar ratio and 0.5 wt% catalyst mass. © 2017","Alternative fuel; Ant colony optimization; Biodiesel; Catalyst; Rice bran oil; Transesterification","Alternative fuels; Ant colony optimization; Biodiesel; Calcination; Catalysts; Electron microscopy; Field emission microscopes; Fossil fuels; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Fuels; Furfural; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Kinematics; Materials testing; Methanol; Scanning electron microscopy; Standards; Transesterification; Transmission electron microscopy; Viscosity; Viscosity of liquids; X ray diffraction; Alternative sources of energy; Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method; Environmental pollutions; Field emission scanning electron microscopy; Rice bran oil; Surface area measurement; Transesterification process; Transesterification reaction; Calcium compounds; algorithm; artificial neural network; biofuel; catalysis; catalyst; chemical process; crop residue; lime; oil; optimization; parameter estimation; qualitative analysis; renewable resource; shell; snail; Adusta; Chicoreus; Murex",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037990888

The present study investigated the production of biodiesel (BFD) as one of the effective methods in solving energy crises and environmental pollution. To increase the consumption of biofuels, a high yield biodiesels (96%) was produced as an alternative to fossil fuels by electrolysis method using graphite electrodes through trans-esterification reaction of WCO and KOH in presence of methanol. This reaction was done in 2 h without side saponification reaction. Biodiesel decreases the environmental effects of waste oil and can cause a new application for using the waste oil. The effect of the catalysis amount, oil/alcohol molar ratio, the amount of co-solvent, water amount, reaction temperature, voltage and the reaction time on biodiesel production were investigated confirming this method as a highly effective way for obtaining high yields. Increasing the catalyst beyond a known level decreases the reaction yield due to saponification side reactions; in consequence, an optimum amount of the catalyst should be used. Without inserting the electricity current in the environment temperature, trans-esterification reaction is done slightly in a long time but proper voltage should be used to obtain high yield, complete the reaction and decrease the reaction time.

MNPs were synthesized by coprecipitation and used to extract algae from aqueous phase at a separation efficiency (SE) of 99%. The SE was optimized at pH 4. Liquefaction of algal/MNPs slurry gave a biocrude yield of 37.1% while algae only yielded 23.2%. The percentage areas in the GC-MS chromatogram corresponding to hydrocarbons (HCs) in Zn-ferrite catalyzed and uncatalyzed biocrude were 46.5% and 19.9%, respectively, while the percentage areas of heptadecane from Zn-ferrite catalyzed and uncatalyzed biocrude were 37.8% and 10%, respectively. Furthermore, the percentage area of heteroatom compounds in biocrude reduced substantially when liquefaction was done in the presence of Zn/Mg ferrites. The nanoparticles were recovered from biochar by sonication and recycled at a SE of 96.1%. Recycling of MNPs for magnetic separation of algae and catalytic HTL could lower the cost of microalgae harvesting and improve the yield and quality of biocrude.

In particular, we were able to heterogenize a water soluble basic catalyst that was not soluble in methanol and separate it from the reaction mixture very easily. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.",,"biodiesel; hydroxyl group; imidazole derivative; interleukin 1; interleukin 2; interleukin 3; interleukin 4; ionic liquid; methanol; silicon dioxide; triacylglycerol; adsorption; Article; biofuel production; catalysis; conformational transition; controlled study; density; desorption; hydrogen bond; priority journal; radical reaction; reaction analysis; reaction time; static electricity; synthesis; temperature sensitivity; thermography; thermostability; titrimetry; transesterification; transmission electron microscopy; X ray diffraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038880875

The key factors influencing the surface ketonization activity over CeO2-based oxides catalysts remain matters of active discourse. Here, a series of Ce1-xFexO2-δ catalysts were investigated for vapor-phase ketonization of acetic and propionic acid. The catalysts were characterized in detail using various physico-chemical techniques both before and after reaction to gain understanding of the ketonization process. The turnover frequency (TOF) based on the basic sites changed with the Fe content. The Ce0.8Fe0.2O2-δ sample showed the prominent ketonization activity with the highest TOF value. On one hand, for samples with a lower Fe addition (x &lt; 0.3), the formed CeO2-like solid solution with numerous Ce-O-Fe species showed a dramatic increase in surface oxygen vacancies. These oxygen vacancies were beneficial to catalytic performance. Moreover, the superior redox properties with weaken M[sbnd]O bonds of Ce-O-Fe species thereby promote the ketonization activity. On the other hand, the higher Fe addition (x &gt; 0.3) caused the damage of the Ce-O-Fe structure, thus reducing ketonization activity. Notably, the investigation of the reaction temperature regime of Ce0.8Fe0.2O2-δ sample directly proved the existence of surface redox cycle during the ketonization process. © 2017","Carboxylic acid; Ce-Fe mixed oxide; Ketonization; Redox cycle","Binary alloys; Carboxylic acids; Catalysts; Cerium alloys; Iron alloys; Iron oxides; Oxygen vacancies; Propionic acid; Redox reactions; Catalytic performance; Ketonization; Mixed oxide; Physicochemical techniques; Reaction temperature; REDOX cycles; Surface oxygen vacancies; Turnover frequency; Cerium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85036460950

To have a comprehensive analysis, diesel and B20 were considered as two baseline fuels and gasoline fumigation was induced at two different ratios. The obtained results reveal that gasoline fumigation increases the energy and exergy efficiency at medium and high loads to about 5% for diesel baseline fuel, while the energy and exergy efficiency decreases slightly in case of B20 fuel with gasoline fumigation. For all operating points, the percentage of energy and exergy transfer through the exhaust gases decreases by an average of 2.6% and 6.4%, respectively in case of using gasoline fumigation for both diesel and B20 fuels. Moreover, the destructed exergy of the engine operating on B20 and the fumigated gasoline was higher than that of diesel and B20 by about 2.4% on the average.

Although promising, pinecone has received inadequate attention as a biofuel feedstock for thermochemical conversion. Water above its critical temperature (TC ≥ 374 °C) and critical pressure (PC ≥ 22.1 MPa), termed as supercritical water, has high kinetic energy and densities similar to that of gases and liquids, respectively. When employed in gasification, supercritical water has an ability to completely dissolve organics and gases. Therefore, this study identifies the candidacy of pinecone as a precursor for conversion to hydrogen through hydrothermal gasification. Pinecone was gasified in subcritical water (300 and 350 °C; 21 MPa), near-critical water (370 °C; 22 MPa) and supercritical water (450 and 550 °C; 23 MPa) to investigate the impacts of temperature (300–550 °C), feed concentration (10–25 wt%) and residence time (15–60 min). The impacts of alkali catalysts (e.g., Na2CO3, NaOH and KOH) at a loading of 30 wt% were examined to maximize hydrogen yields. The hydrochar generated from gasification in subcritical water, near-critical water and supercritical water were physico-chemically characterized through proximate and ultimate analysis (carbon-hydrogen-nitrogen-sulfur-oxygen), thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, Scanning electron microscopy and Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In the non-catalytic gasification of pinecone, highest hydrogen (1.42 mmol/g) and total gas yields (6.6 mmol/g) with lower heating value (488 kJ/Nm3) of the gas products were obtained in supercritical water at 550 °C with 10 wt% feed concentration for 60 min. Moreover, at 30 wt% catalyst loading, highest hydrogen yield was obtained from KOH (3.26 mmol/g) followed by NaOH (2.71 mmol/g) and Na2CO3 (1.96 mmol/g). Hydrochars generated in supercritical water at 550 °C had a greater content of aromatic carbon and were thermally stable. The findings reveal, for the first time, the potential of pinecone for hydrogen production through subcritical, near-critical and supercritical water gasification, as well as the prospective of its hydrochar for environmental and material applications. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Gasification; Hydrochar; Hydrogen; Pinecone; Subcritical water; Supercritical water","Calorific value; Carbon; Catalysts; Gasification; Hydrogen; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Lignocellulosic biomass; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Potassium hydroxide; Scanning electron microscopy; Sodium Carbonate; Sodium hydroxide; Spectrum analysis; Thermogravimetric analysis; Fourier transform infra reds; Hydrochar; Hydrothermal gasification; Pinecone; Sub-critical water; Supercritical water; Supercritical water gasification; Thermochemical Conversion; Hydrogen production",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031752160

However, this technology has not yet been fully employed in real practice because of highly viscous and complex chemical nature of pyrolytic products and also due to lack of adequate understanding of such non-isothermal reactions. Catalysts can be used to upgrade the quality of bio-oils by enhancing the pyrolysis reaction efficiency and breaking down higher molecular weight compounds into simpler products. The study of the kinetics of this pyrolysis process explicates in depth knowledge about the reaction mechanism to have a better control over the efficiency of pyrolysis conversion of the biomass constituent. In this study, we focus on the kinetic analysis of ceria nanoparticles catalysed pyrolysis of cellulose, the major constituent of lignocellulosic biomass, for production of high-quality bio-oil. A non-isothermal kinetic analysis method identifies the reaction to be following a ‘one and a half order’ pathway and establishes significant lowering of activation energy after addition of the nanocatalyst. The merit of the nanocatalyst was again ascertained by performing qualitative analysis of pyrolytic liquids from cellulose in the presence of both bulk and nanosized ceria catalysts. It was observed that CeO2 nanoparticles improved the pyrolysis process enhancing the C–C bond scission reactions. As a result, percentage amount of lower molecular weight (96–144) compounds in the pyrolytic liquids increased with the addition of nanocatalyst (highest being 100% for 7% ceria nanocatalyst). © 2017, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","Bio-oil; Catalysts; Ceria nanoparticles; Kinetics","Activation analysis; Activation energy; Biofuels; Biomass; Catalysis; Catalysts; Cellulose; Chemical analysis; Enzyme kinetics; Isotherms; Kinetics; Molecular weight; Nanoparticles; Quality control; Reaction kinetics; Bio oil; Biomass constituents; Ceria nanoparticles; In-depth knowledge; Lignocellulosic biomass; Non-isothermal kinetic; Nonisothermal reactions; Qualitative analysis; Pyrolysis; Biomass; Catalysts; Cerium Compounds; Pyrolysis; Volatile Oil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020306512

However, the hydrothermal and high pressure operating conditions of APR limit the reaction kinetics, thermodynamics and catalyst stability. To overcome these limitations, an active and durable catalyst should be developed to selectively convert oxygenated hydrocarbons into hydrogen. For this study, methanol was selected as a model compound. Nickel-based catalysts with dopants such as copper and cerium and different supports were tested for the APR of methanol.

This has triggered numerous researches in green hydrocarbon alternatives from renewable oil. Microalgae is one of the potential sources of green hydrocarbon, which will reduce the dependency on fossil fuel. This is because microalgae have a high oil or lipid content, rapid growth rate, and high ability to sequester carbon dioxide. Besides that, their cultivation does not require arable land and will, therefore not compete with global food production. The current biofuel production is based on the transesterification of triglyceride to biodiesel which suffered from several drawbacks such as high acidity, high viscosity, and low heating value, etc. A more efficient reaction route needs to be developed to produce biofuel which possesses similar properties as the fossil-derived fuel. Therefore, this review aims to encompass the conversion of microalgae oil towards green hydrocarbons via various catalytic reactions. The fundamental chemistry and mechanisms involved in the conversion of microalgae oil to useful chemical products are also discussed in detail. © 2017 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers","Biofuel; Catalytic conversion; Green hydrocarbon; Lipid content; Microalgae","Algae; Biofuels; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Catalysis; Fossil fuels; Fuels; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Hydrocarbons; Oils and fats; Biofuel production; Catalytic conversion; Catalytic reactions; Lipid content; Low heating values; Micro-algae; Potential sources; Useful chemicals; Microorganisms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026887441

The main challenge to biodiesel production from low-quality oils (used oils and greases) is the high percentage of free fatty acids (FFAs) and water in the feedstock that causes undesirable side reactions. The catalytic materials studied were tested in the transesterification reaction when using low-quality oils containing a high proportion of free fatty acids (FFAs) and water. Results indicated that the amount of acid and basic sites on the catalytic surface increases upon increasing potassium loading in the catalyst, displaying better performance for biodiesel production. Indeed, the modification of the aluminum silicate substrate upon potassium incorporation results in a catalytic material containing both acidic and basic sites, which are responsible for both triglycerides transesterification and FFA esterification reactions. The studied catalyst not only showed good performance in the biodiesel production reaction but also good tolerance to FFA and water contained in the feedstock for biodiesel production. The catalytic material was microstructured by 3D printing in order to design a catalytic stirring system with high mechanical strength, efficient and reusable. The use of 3D printing in biofuel production is a novelty that brings good solutions for catalyst production. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","3D printing; Biodiesel; Esterification/transesterification; Heterogeneous catalyst; Non-edible oil; Waste oil","3D printers; Aluminosilicates; Catalysts; Esterification; Esters; Fatty acids; Feedstocks; Mullite; Potassium; Transesterification; 3-D printing; Esterification reactions; Heterogeneous catalyst; High mechanical strength; Non-edible oil; Renewable feedstocks; Transesterification reaction; Waste oil; Biodiesel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026465028

Castor oil has been extracted from the seeds by mechanical press and the Soxhlet extraction method. Maximum oil content of 55.7% has been found by the Soxhlet extraction method. The physicochemical properties such as free fatty acid (FFA) content, kinematic viscosity, saponification value, and density of the oil have been measured by different standard methods. The FFA content and viscosity have been found considerably higher such as 33.5% and 253 mm2/s, respectively. Biodiesel has been prepared using a three-step method comprising of saponification of oil followed by acidification of the soap and esterification of FFA. The overall yield of FFA from CO is found to be around 89.2%. The final step is esterification that produces fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) and a maximum 97.4% conversion of FFA to biodiesel has been observed. The effect of the oil to methanol molar ratio, catalyst concentration, reaction temperature, and time has been investigated for esterification reaction and optimized using the response surface methodology. 1H NMR of crude castor oil and castor oil methyl ester (COME) was studied and analyzed that confirms the complete conversion of castor oil to biodiesel. Finally, the biodiesel, produced under optimum conditions, was characterized using the various standard method and found comparable with petro-diesel and biodiesel standard. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Biodiesel; castor oil; esterification; RSM; three-step method","Biodiesel; Esterification; Esters; Extraction; Fatty acids; Hydrolysis; Presses (machine tools); Vegetable oils; Viscosity; Castor oil; Castor oil methyl esters; Catalyst concentration; Esterification reactions; Fatty acid methyl ester; Physicochemical property; Response surface methodology; Step method; Oilseeds; biofuel; crude oil; gas production; optimization; physicochemical property; viscosity; Bangladesh",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029407618

The main advantages of this technology for production of biofuel are that it does not require predrying of the feedstock and ensures a relatively high product yield—the ratio of the end product weight to the feedstock weight—owing to the fact that all the microalgal components, viz., lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates, are converted into biofuel. MA hydrothermal liquefaction is considered to be a promising technology for conversion of biomass and is a subject of a series of research studies and, judging by the available publications, the scope of research in this field is expanding currently. However, many significant problems remain unsolved. In particular, an active searched is being conducted for suitable strains that will ensure not only a high lipid yield—necessary to convert microalgae into biodiesel—but also higher biomass productivity and a higher biofuel yield; the chemical reactions that occur during the hydrothermal treatment are being studied; and the effect of significant process variables, such as temperature, heating rate, holdup time at the maximum temperature, biomass concentration in the water suspension, biochemical and elemental compositions of the microalgae, use of catalysts, etc., on the liquefaction processes is being studied. One of the urgent tasks is also the reduction of the nitrogen content in the resulting biofuel. Studies aimed at the development of a continuous process and rational heat-processing plants for thermal microalgal conversion are being conducted to increase the energy efficiency of the HTL process, in particular, to provide the heat recovery and separation of the end product. © 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.","biocrude oil; biofuel; hydrothermal liquefaction; microalgae","Algae; Biomass; Energy efficiency; Feedstocks; Liquefaction; Microorganisms; Suspensions (fluids); Waste heat; Biocrude oil; Biomass concentrations; Biomass productivity; Elemental compositions; Hydrothermal liquefactions; Hydrothermal treatments; Liquefaction process; Micro-algae; Biofuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028038181

Previously reported methods for achieving electron transfer from enzymes to electrodes have relied on the use of complex biomolecule immobilization procedures, complicated matrix materials, or enzyme engineering, resulting in potential relative toxicity, high cost, as well as limited stability. Here, we report a facile method for the rapid preparation of a glucose oxidase (GOx) anode with direct electron transfer (DET) for glucose BFCs and biosensors. GOx is directly incorporated into pretreated carbon paper (CP) by adjusting the pH of the incubation medium during the immobilization process. Eexcellent bioelectrocatalytic activity is obtained when GOx is incorporated into CP near the pI of GOx. The electron transfer rate constant (ks) and the apparent Michaelis-Menten constant (kMapp) are estimated to be 12.08 ± 1.0 s-1 and 0.13 ± 0.01 mM, respectively.

The Pd-POP materials prepared by the three different synthetic methods consist of virtually identical chemical compositions but have different physical and texture properties. Strong metal–support interactions, the nanoconfinement effect of POP, and the homogeneous distribution of Pd NPs have been investigated by performing 13C cross-polarization (CP) solid-state magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR, FTIR, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), along with wide-angle powder XRD, N2 physisorption, high-resolution (HR)-TEM, high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping spectroscopic studies. The resulting Pd-POP based materials exhibit highly efficient catalytic performance with superior stability in promoting biomass refining (hydrodeoxygenation of vanillin, a typical compound of lignin-derived bio-oil). Outstanding catalytic performance (≈98 % conversion of vanillin with exclusive selectivity for hydrogenolysis product 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol) has been achieved over the newly designed Pd-POP catalyst under the optimized reaction conditions (140 °C, 10 bar H2 pressure), affording a turnover frequency (TOF) value of 8.51 h−1 and no significant drop in catalytic activity with desired product selectivity has been noticed for ten successive catalytic cycles, demonstrating the excellent stability and reproducibility of this catalyst system. A size- and location-dependent catalytic performance for the Pd NPs with small size (1.31±0.36 and 2.71±0.25 nm) has been investigated in vanillin hydrodeoxygenation reaction with our newly designed Pd-POP catalysts. The presence of well-dispersed electron-rich metallic Pd sites and highly rigid cross-linked amine-functionalized POP framework with high surface area is thought to be responsible for the high catalytic activity and improvement in catalyst stability. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In this study, bifunctional Zn/HZSM-5 catalysts were firstly combined with supercritical ethanol to produce bio-crude in pine sawdust catalytic liquefaction. The catalysts were characterized by BET, NH3-TPD, XRD and TEM. The effects of Zn/HZSM-5 catalysts with different Zn loading ratios on the yield and quality of bio-crude and gas were investigated. The results showed that Zn/HZSM-5 and HZSM-5 catalysts improved the yields of bio-crude compared to no catalyst treatment. The use of HZSM-5 based catalysts reduced the contents of oxygenated compounds including acids, ketones, phenols and alcohols in bio-crude products. Hydrocarbons content of the bio-crudes produced by HZSM-5 based catalysts increased compared to bio-crude produced by no catalyst treatment. Compared to HZSM-5 catalyst, Zn/HZSM-5 catalysts exhibited better catalyst performance to improve bio-crude quality due to the additional decarbonylation, decarboxylation and dehydrogenation reactions induced by Zn loading. 15%Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst resulted in the highest yields of bio-crude at 59.09 wt.%, and 10%Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst produced bio-crude with the highest hydrocarbons content at 15.03%.

In order to realize economically viable production of DMF and MF from biomass, catalytic processes with high yields, low catalyst costs, and process simplicity are needed. Here, we demonstrate simultaneous coprocessing of HMF and FF over Cu-Ni/TiO2 catalysts, achieving 87.5% yield of DMF from HMF and 88.5% yield of MF from FF in a one pot reaction. The Cu-Ni/TiO2 catalyst exhibited improved stability and regeneration compared to Cu/TiO2 and Cu/Al2O3 catalysts for FF HDO, with a ∼7% loss in FF conversion over four sequential recycles, compared to a ∼50% loss in FF conversion for Cu/Al2O3 and a ∼30% loss in conversion for Cu/TiO2. Characterization of the Cu-Ni/TiO2 catalyst by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and H2-temperature-programmed reduction and comparison to monometallic Cu and Ni on Al2O3 and TiO2 and bimetallic Cu-Ni/Al2O3 catalysts suggest that the unique reactivity and stability of Cu-Ni/TiO2 derives from support-induced metal segregation in which Cu is selectively enriched at the catalyst surface, while Ni is enriched at the TiO2 interface. These results demonstrate that Cu-Ni/TiO2 catalysts promise to be a system capable of integrating directly with a combined HMF and FF product stream from biomass processing to realize lower cost production of liquid fuels from biomass. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","bimetallic catalysts; biofuels; furfural; hydrodeoxygenation; hydroxymethyl furfural; support effects","Aldehydes; Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Aromatic compounds; Biofuels; Biomass; Catalysts; Fuel additives; Furfural; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Methanol; Nickel; Organic pollutants; Scanning electron microscopy; Surface segregation; Titanium dioxide; Transmission electron microscopy; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Bimetallic catalysts; Biomass-derived fuels; Catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO); H2 temperature-programmed reduction; Hydrodeoxygenation; Hydroxymethyl furfural; Scanning transmission electron microscopy; Support effects; Copper",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020879067

As an alternative to fossil fuels, first and second generation biofuel was developed from corn, grains and lignocellulosic agricultural residues. These generations are inefficient in achieving the desired rate of biofuel production, climate change mitigation and economic growth. Therefore, third generation biofuel specifically derived from microalgae have proved to be a promising unconventional energy source. Microalgae are microscopic organisms that grow in salt or fresh water and have been used for producing metabolites, cosmetics and for energy production. The conventional approaches used for biofuel production include pyrolysis, gasification, direct combustion and thermomechanical liquefaction. The search for biological and eco-friendly approaches led to the emergence of Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC), which provide a new solution to energy crisis. Integration of photosynthetic organisms such as microalgae into MFC resulted in a new approach i.e. Microbial Solar Cell, which can convert solar energy into electrical energy via photosynthesis. Microbial solar cells have broad range application in wastewater treatment, biodiesel processing and intermediate metabolite production.","Biofuel; Biomass conversion; Microalgae; Microbial fuel cell; Microbial solar cell","biodiesel; biofuel; cosmetic; fertilizer; food dye; fresh water; sodium chloride; Article; biofuel production; biomass conversion; climate change; combustion; dietary supplement; economic development; energy resource; energy yield; fermentation; gasification; harvesting; liquefaction; microalga; microbial fuel cell; nonhuman; photobioreactor; phototrophy; pond; pyrolysis; solar cell; solar energy; transesterification; trend study; waste water management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024105542

Inexpensive transition metals, including Fe, Ni, Cu, and Zn, were severally co-loaded with Ru on HY zeolite to form bimetallic and bifunctional catalysts. These catalysts were subsequently tested for HDO conversion of softwood lignin and several lignin model compounds. Results indicated that the inexpensive earth-abundant metals could modulate the hydrogenolysis activity of Ru and decrease the yield of low-molecular-weight gaseous products. Among these catalysts, Ru-Cu/HY showed the best HDO performance, affording the highest selectivity to hydrocarbon products. The improved catalytic performance of Ru-Cu/HY was probably a result of the following three factors: (1) high total and strong acid sites, (2) good dispersion of metal species and limited segregation, and (3) high adsorption capacity for polar fractions, including hydroxyl groups and ether bonds. Moreover, all bifunctional catalysts proved to be superior over the combination catalysts of Ru/Al2O3 and HY zeolite. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The experimental results showed that both the biohydrogen yield and the chemical oxygen demand removal were improved through the combination of BW and PPME.

Among them, valeric esters derived from γ-valerolactone (GVL) are regarded as one of the most promising alternatives to fossil fuels. Herein, the highly efficient one-pot transformation of GVL to produce a series of valeric esters was successfully achieved over novel ZrO2-incorporated ZnAl2O4-composite-supported Cu-based catalysts. An extensive investigation gave clear evidence that the incorporation of ZrO2 into composites could lead to the enhanced metal dispersion and surface acidity. Especially, the catalyst with a Zr/Zn mass ratio of 0.2 exhibited the best selectivity of 99% in the transformation of GVL into pentyl valerate to date, together with a comparable conversion of 91% with respect to the Cu-based catalyst previously reported. The superior catalytic performance was attributable to the surface cooperation effect between highly dispersed active copper species and abundant surface acid sites. Especially, different surface types of acidic sites on catalysts could induce the reaction to efficiently proceed in different paths.

XRD, FESEM, EDX, FTIR and BET analyses exhibited smaller particles with higher surface area and less population of particle aggregates at highly irradiated nanocatalysts.

Herein, we designed surface-clean NPG structures with high-index facets by a trisodium citrate (Na3Cit) self-initiated reduction of chloroauric acid (HAuCl4) in a water-ice bath followed by a kinetically controlled self-assembly manner. This strategy breaks through the traditional trisodium citrate thermal-reducing chloroauric acid approach where solutions are required to heat to a certain temperature for the reaction to initiate. However, herein, the surface-clean NPG structures yielded highly enhanced catalytic activity in glucose electrooxidation with approximately 9 A cm−2 mg−1 current density, which is over 20 times higher than that of Au nanoparticles devised by Turkevich (Turkevich-Au NPs) under the same conditions. This remarkable electrocatalytic activity could be ascribed to the large electrochemically active surface area, clean surface, and high-index facets or highly active sites of the porous structure.

This report describes surface modification of a bifunctional rht-type metal-organic framework (MOF, Cu-TDPAT) with nanosized electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (n-ERGO). The hybrid strategy results in a Cu-TDPAT-n-ERGO sensor with sensitive and selective response toward hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Compared with Cu-TDPAT, Cu-TDPAT-n-ERGO exhibits significantly enhanced electrocatalytic activities, highlighting the importance of n-ERGO in boosting their electrocatalytic activity. The sensor shows a wide linear detection range (4-12 000 μM), and the detection limit is 0.17 μM (S/N = 3) which is even lower than horseradish peroxidase or recently published noble metal nanomaterial based biosensors. Moreover, the sensor displays decent stability, excellent anti-interference performance, and applicability in human serum and urine samples. Such good sensing performance can be explained by the synergetic effect of bifunctional Cu-TDPAT (open metal sites and Lewis basic sites) and n-ERGO (excellent conductive property).

Both methanol and ethanol have been used as alcohol in transesterification reaction, but as methanol is normally derived from fossil resources, biodiesel produced cannot be termed as completely renewable. As per policies of government of India, Ethanol is being promoted as potential biofuel because it is derived from biomass feedstock. Along with its direct use as biofuel, ethanol can also be incorporated as solvent alcohol in transesterification reaction. This work is an attempt to investigate the potential of ethanol in Karanja biodiesel production by analysis of kinetics of transesterification and its comparison with methanol transesterification. The result of experimental investigation shows that maximum yield of 88.7% and 77% was obtained for methanolysis and ethanolysis respectively at reaction temperature 60 °C, 9:1 molar ratio (alcohol to oil), 1.25 wt.% catalyst loading (KOH) and reaction time of 120 min. It was observed that rate constant and activation energy was 0.007105 min−1 and 20.19 kJ/mol for methanolysis respectively whereas same for ethanolysis was 0.006294 min−1 and 23.35 kJ/mol for ethanolysis. This shows that transesterification reaction proceeds slower when ethanol is used and more energy is required. Fuel properties of ethyl ester of Karanja Oil were found to be superior as compared to corresponding methyl ester. Still it is viable option from Indian prospective because Government of India is promoting the use of ethanol as a potential source of biofuel due to its renewable nature. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Activation energy; Biodiesel; Ethanol; Kinetics; Methanol; Transesterification","Activation energy; Biodiesel; Biofuels; Chemical activation; Enzyme kinetics; Esters; Ethanol; Feedstocks; Kinetics; Methanol; Rate constants; Transesterification; Bio-based feedstock; Biodiesel production; Catalyst loadings; Comprehensive analysis; Experimental investigations; Government of India; Reaction temperature; Transesterification reaction; Organic solvents",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992060936

When the enzyme layer was sandwiched between two layers of MWCNTs, significant improvement of DET oxygen reduction occurred at pH 7.0, which was ascribed to the presence of local negative charges and to π-π interactions favoring enzyme orientation. The electrode preparation is simple and results in an efficient biocathode with BOD non-specifically attached to the porous material.

Since LA has different functional groups, it would be converted into various compounds by catalyzed reactions. During the past few decades, it has been proved that the conversion of biomass materials into biofuels and chemicals with LA as intermediate is feasible. Alkyl levulinates derived from LA have similar chemical properties to LA and are also used for the synthesis of LA derived molecules. Herein, this review focuses on the transformation of levulinic acid and alkyl levulinate into biofuels and high-valued chemicals, such as γ-valerolactone, 2-methyltetrahydrofurnan, valeric acid/alkyl valerates, 1,4-pentanediol and N-substituted pyrrolidinones. Different homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts are reviewed and compared. The ligands and additives exhibit a remarkable impact on the distribution of products in homogeneous catalytic systems. Moreover, the catalytic performances of heterogeneous catalytic systems are influenced by numerous factors, such as the size of the metal particles, surface morphology and acid density. In addition, in order to make this review more complete, the production of LA and alkyl levulinates is also included in the manuscript. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035749102

Herein, a highly efficient vapor-phase dehydrogenation-hydrogenation coupling process over bimetallic Ni-Cu alloy nanocatalysts was established for the synchronized production of phenol and DMF with unprecedentedly high yields (>97%) from two cyclohexanol (CHL) and biomass-derived 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) substrates, without any external hydrogen and oxygen supply. Systematic characterization and catalytic experiments revealed that the production of phenol went through a consecutive triple-dehydrogenation process from CHL, while HMF was simultaneously hydrogenated into DMF using active hydrogen species generated from the dehydrogenation process. The bimetallic Ni-Cu alloy nanostructures derived from Ni-Cu-Al layered double hydroxide precursors and strong metal-support interactions play important roles in governing the present coupling process. An appropriate Ni-Cu alloy nanostructure could greatly facilitate the dehydrogenative aromatization of CHL, thus significantly improving the selectivities to both phenol and DMF. Such an unparalleled efficient, eco-friendly and versatile coupling process for the synchronized production of various substituted phenols and DMF makes it practically promising for large-scale industrial applications in terms of green chemistry and sustainable development. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029739123

However, syngas can be produced by biomass gasification as well. One of the main problems is the need to ensure high H2/CO ratio to allow the Fischer-Tropsch reaction to occur, operation commonly achieved by resorting to a Water-gas shift step. The present work reports an experimental study on biomass gasification. The aim was to set up a more efficient Biomass-to-Liquid process, which ensures a high H2/CO ratio syngas suitable for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis directly from biomass gasification. In this way, it is possible to remove the Water-gas shift section and consequently make biofuels production more attractive, reducing costs and plant complexity. Two types of biomass have been tested: softwood from forest residues and fast growing crops. Moreover, a bubbling fluidized bed reactor and an indirect gasifier with internal circulating fluidized bed have been used. Gasification tests have been conducted by running gasifiers with both inert and catalytic bed materials. The results have shown that, using the direct gasifier with catalytic bed and a proper configuration, H2/CO molar ratio of 2 can been obtained even at low temperature and low steam/biomass ratio, whereas this is not the case in the indirect one. However, tests suggest that an inverted configuration would make it possible to obtain values near two also with indirect gasifiers, resulting in a new interesting approach. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biofuels; Biomass-to-Liquid (BtL); Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; Gasification; H2/CO ratio; Syngas","Biofuels; Biomass; Carbon monoxide; Chemical reactors; Chemical shift; Coal liquefaction; Fluidized bed process; Fluidized beds; Gasification; Liquids; Molar ratio; Synthesis gas; Synthetic fuels; Temperature; Water gas shift; Biomass To Liquid; Bubbling fluidized bed reactor; Circulating fluidized bed; Fischer-Tropsch process; Fischer-Tropsch reaction; H2/CO ratio; Syn-gas; Water gas shift section; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; biofuel; carbon monoxide; catalysis; chemical reaction; crop residue; equipment; experimental study; low temperature; temperature effect",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028511329

A series of Li/TiO2 was prepared with different amounts of Li (20, 30, 40 wt %) and at different calcination temperatures (450, 600, 750). The Li/TiO2 catalysts were characterized by several spectroscopic and analytical techniques like XRD, FT-IR, BET, TG-DSC and FESEM. The XRD study revealed that the insertion of Li improved the catalyst efficiency without any alteration in structure of TiO2. Li/TiO2 catalysts with 30%w/w Li and calcined at 600 °C was found to be the most efficient with 98% transesterification yield. The best performance of catalyst was achieved with methanol to oil ratio of 24:1, 5 wt % of catalyst loading, at 55 °C reaction temperatures for 3 h of reaction time.

The density and viscosity of CBDEs increased by 10.7% and 159.3% with increasing bio-oil concentration up to 25%, respectively. Meanwhile, the calorific value was correspondingly reduced by 18.5%. Compared to diesel, a lower specific fuel consumption was achieved with the CBDE fuels at medium and high powers. This was attributed to micro-explosion, which resulted in more thorough splitting of fuel droplets caused by the instantaneous and intense vaporization of water, thereby significantly improving fuel vaporization and combustion process. In addition, the addition of Ce0.7Zr0.3O2 nanoparticles led to reduced ignition delay and rapid oxidation, thus resulting in more complete combustion. The specific fuel consumption of CBDEs first decreased and then increased in correlation to the increased bio-oil content, in which CBDEs with bio-oil proportion of 20% showed the lowest and had the highest fuel saving rate close to 8.4%. By comparison of diesel, the CBDEs with lower bio-oil proportion than 20% reduced CO, HC and smoke emission, which were decreased by reducing bio-oil content.

Despite this, more needs to be done to remove the technical barriers associated with biodiesel production and usage, to increase its quality as well as to widen the choice of available feedstocks; so as to avoid over-dependence on limited sources. This paper assesses the feasibility of using a local plant, Reutealis trisperma, whose seeds contain a high percentage of oil of up to 51%, as one of the possible feedstocks. The techno-economic and sensitivity analysis of biodiesel production from Reutealis trisperma oil as well as implementation aspects and environmental effects of the biodiesel plant are discussed. Analysis indicates that the 50 kt Reutealis trisperma biodiesel production plant has a life cycle cost of approximately 710 million, yielding a payback period of 4.34 years. The unit cost of the biodiesel is calculated to be 0.69/L with the feedstock cost accounting for the bulk of the cost. The most important finding from this study is that the biodiesel from Reutealis trisperma oil can compete with fossil diesel, provided that appropriate policies of tax exemptions and subsidies can be put in place. To conclude, further studies on biodiesel production and its limitations are necessary before the use of biodiesel from Reutealis trisperma oil may be used as a fuel source to replace fossil diesel. © 2017 by the authors.","Biodiesel; Biofuel economy; Life cycle cost; Non-edible oil; Reutealis trisperma","Biodiesel; Cost accounting; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Economic analysis; Feedstocks; Investments; Seed; Sensitivity analysis; Taxation; Well stimulation; Biodiesel production; Biofuel economies; Implementation aspects; Lifecycle costs; Non-edible oil; Reutealis trisperma; Second generation; Technical barriers; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025438707

The synthesis of biofuel 2-methylfuran typically derives from the conversion of the formyl group of biomass-derived furfural, because this process is very valuable in terms of the amelioration and remission of the environment and energy crisis. Herein, we designed a series of bifunctional catalysts formed in line with the spatial restriction strategy by anchoring copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) on phyllosilicate-like structures to enhance copper dispersion and provide properly assembled Lewis acid sites to promote the hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis of the formyl group in furfural, and first applied them to the conversion of the formyl group with high efficiency. However, the modulation of the Cu-Si molar ratio is extremely critical to the possible reduction of metal consumption, full exploitation of the prerequisite metal sites and great improvement of activity. In this work, the catalyst with a Cu-Si molar ratio (actual value = 0.33) lower than that of the industrial catalyst (theoretical value = 1.0) exhibited higher yields of the intermediate furfuryl alcohol (yield = 83.4%) and the desired product 2-methylfuran (yield = 95.5%). More importantly, with the continuous increase of the Cu-Si molar ratio, it is discovered that Cu dispersion regularly decreased and the size of the Cu NPs sequentially increased, and the change of assembled Lewis acid sites surprisingly kept pace with the integrity of the layered structure, as revealed by a series of detailed characterization studies. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Aldehydes; Copper; Dispersions; Energy policy; Furfural; Silicon; Bi-functional catalysts; Characterization studies; Controlled synthesis; Copper nanoparticles; Design and Development; Environment and energies; Heterogeneous catalyst; Spatial restrictions; Catalysts",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85022189378

Hydrogen ASBR unit was operated at a constant pH of 5.5 whereas the pH of methane ASBR unit was not controlled. Glycerin was added into biodiesel wastewater having 2330 mg/l COD to obtain a constant feed chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 45,000 m/l. At optimum COD loading rate 11.3 kg/m3d (based on feed COD load and methane ASBR volume), the system provided the highest overall hydrogen and methane production performance (75.15 ml H2/g glycerin removed) which was consistent with the maximum overall COD removal of 76.7% and the highest overall glycerin uptake of 90%. Most of added glycerin was converted to gaseous products with small amounts of organic acids and 1,3 propanediol.

Furthermore, the best selectivity for hydrogen yield (6.08 mmol/g macroalgae) and lowest amount of acetic acid (5.4 wt%) was observed for CoMo/ZH-20 catalyst, that is synthesized by 20 wt% of zeolite. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Algae; Bio-oil; Gracilaria gracilis; HZSM-5/HMS composites; Pyrolysis","Acetic acid; Algae; Biofuels; Catalysts; Hydrogen production; Organic acids; pH; Phenols; Pyrolysis; Zeolites; Bio oil; Catalytic pyrolysis; Catalytic upgrading; Gracilaria; H-ZSM-5; Hydrogen yields; Structure of composites; Weight percentages; Catalyst selectivity; 2 pyrrolidinone; 2,3 butanedione; acetic acid; acetone; carbon; cresol; formic acid; furfural; hydrogen; nitrogen; oxygen; phenol; sulfur; trimethylamine; zeolite; biofuel; acetic acid; biotechnology; catalysis; composite; concentration (composition); formic acid; macroalga; oil; phenol; pyrolysis; red alga; zeolite; agricultural waste; Article; biofuel production; biomass; carbon balance; catalysis; catalyst; Gracilaria; Gracilaria gracilis; mass fragmentography; nonhuman; physical chemistry; priority journal; pyrolysis; structure analysis; synthesis; temperature; heat; seaweed; algae; Gracilaria gracilis; Biofuels; Catalysis; Gracilaria; Hot Temperature; Seaweed; Zeolites",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021205382

In the current study, first, synthesis of Na+ZSM-5 nanocrystals with well-distribution in size was performed successfully with a novel technique in supercritical water. After converting to H+ZSM-5 type, it was applied for hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) of crude bio-oil, obtained from hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of chlorella sp. microalgae, in the presence of high temperature water and formic acid (HCOOH) mixture. The effects of reaction temperature (250–500 °C), formic acid as a source of in-situ hydrogen, and nano-catalyst (compared with industrial type) on nitrogen elimination and H/C ratio were investigated comprehensively. Compared with non-catalytic upgrading conditions, a substantial amount of nitrogen removal was obtained in the presence of nano-catalyst and formic acid with the maximum amount of 75 wt% at 400 °C in comparison with the macron-size industrial catalyst (54 wt%) at the same temperature. Due to more miscibility and consequently high degree of liquid fuel recovery (Yliq) with less coking as well as more HDN, T = 400 °C was chosen as the optimum temperature. Furthermore, H/C ratio of upgraded bio-oil, as an index of aromatization, had similar trend which indicates that in the presence of H+ZSM-5, higher temperature is more favorable to aromatization than cracking which makes HDN more difficult. In the absence of a catalyst, H/C ratio showed no substantial trend with temperature which demonstrates the significance of H+ZSM-5 catalyst for cracking. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Chlorella sp. microalgae; Formic acid; H+ZSM-5 nanocatalyst; Hydrodenitrogenation; Supercritical water","Algae; Biofuels; Catalysts; Cracks; Formic acid; Microorganisms; Mixtures; Nitrogen; Nitrogen removal; High-temperature water; Hydrodenitrogenation; Hydrothermal liquefactions; Micro-algae; Nano-catalyst; Nitrogen elimination; Reaction temperature; Supercritical water; Catalytic cracking",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020855633

It was found that the treatment of the natural zeolite (clinoptilolite zeolite) with KOH significantly decreased its silica content by desilication and increased its K+ content by formation of hydroxylpotaslite.

While the majority of heterogeneous catalytic processes are conducted in the presence of gas (nearly ideal) or liquid phase, a growing number of processes are utilizing supercritical fluids (SCFs) as reaction media. Although hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is proven a promising process for pyrolysis bio-oil upgrading to hydrocarbon biofuel, catalyst efficiency remains a challenge. Integrating heterogeneous catalysts with SCFs in a bio-oil HDO process was investigated in this study. Bifunctional Co-Zn/HZSM-5 catalysts were firstly used to upgrade bio-oil to biofuel in supercritical methanol. The loading of Co and Zn did not change HZSM-5 crystalline structure. Physicochemical properties of biofuel produced by Co and/or Zn loaded HZSM-5 catalysts such as water content, total acid number, viscosity and higher heating value improved. Bimetallic Co-Zn/HZSM-5 catalysts showed enhanced reactions of decarboxylation and decarbonylation that resulted in higher yields of CO and CO2. Bimetallic Co-Zn/HZSM-5 catalysts were more effective for bio-oil HDO than monometallic Co/HZSM-5 or Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst which was attributed to the synergistic effect of Co and Zn on HZSM-5 support. Bimetallic Co-Zn/HZSM-5 catalysts increased biofuel yields and hydrocarbons contents in biofuels in comparison with monometallic Co/HZSM-5 and Zn/HZSM-5 catalysts. 5%Co15%Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst generated the highest biofuel yield at 22.13 wt.%, and 15%Co5%Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst produced biofuel with the highest hydrocarbons content at 35.33%. Hydrogenation and esterification are two dominant reactions in bio-oil HDO over Co-Zn/HZSM-5 catalysts in supercritical methanol. The energy efficiency of biofuel product was 30.99–58.80% for Co-Zn/HZSM-5 catalysts.

The negatively charged hydride (H−) of readily available polymethylhydrosiloxane (PMHS) acting as green H-donor over hydrophobic Pd nanoparticles did not obstruct upstream reactions (e.g., hydrolysis, isomerization and dehydration) for the in situ formation of furanic aldehydes/alcohols from sugars, and could selectively facilitate the subsequent hydrodeoxygenation of carbonyl and hydroxyl groups other than the furanic ring in one pot, as clarified by deuterium-labeling study. Importantly, the unreduced Pd(II) nanocatalysts also exhibited comparable performance in the selective hydrodeoxygenation reaction. Moreover, the catalytic strategy was extended to various carboxides for quantitative production of corresponding furanic/aromatic hydrocarbons at room temperature that were more pronounced than previously reported results, and the optimal Pd/MIL-53(Al) coated with polydimethylsiloxane (Pd/MIL-53(Al)-P) was highly stable with little deactivation and Pd leaching for at least five consecutive cycles. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Biomass conversion; Isotopic study; Liquid biofuel; Pd nanocatalyst; Single-step process","Aluminum; Aluminum coatings; Bioconversion; Catalyst selectivity; Hydrocarbons; Hydrophobicity; Liquids; Palladium compounds; Silicones; Sugars; Biomass conversion; Isotopic study; Liquid biofuels; Nano-catalyst; Single-step process; Biofuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019546484

A novel waste eggshell of Gallus domesticus derived superbasic nanocatalyst was synthesized through betaine amphoteric surfactant-assisted decomposition, adsorption and precipitation processes. By varied the duration synthesis of gel mixture, the morphology transformation from liquid-solid interconnected macro-size particles to regular spheroidal nanoassemblies particles is detected. The surfactant at the liquid-solid interface facilitates the mono dispersion of nanoparticles by hindering growth of crystals. The average particle diameter of the produced superbasic nanocatalyst was in the range of 27–16 nm. The synthesized nanoparticle formation mechanism in the presence surfactant has also been addressed in this study. The catalytic activity of superbasic nanocatalyst was investigated for biodiesel production from crude Jatropha curcas oil (JCO) via glycerolysis and transesterification with methanol at atmospheric pressure. Artificial neural network (ANN) based on the genetic algorithm (GA) was applied for optimization of varied reaction parameters. It was observed that the reduction of acidity varied with varying reaction conditions.

Hydrodeoxygenation is a promising route for upgraded bio-oil production from pyrolysis bio-oil. Non-sulfide catalysts are effective in bio-oil hydrodeoxygenation due to low cost and high activity. Ni-Zn/Al2O3 catalysts were first used to selectively produce hydrocarbon upgraded bio-oil through bio-oil hydrodeoxygenation. Upgrading pine sawdust bio-oil to upgraded hydrocarbon bio-oil was performed using a series of Ni and/or Zn loaded Al2O3 catalysts. The crystalline structure of Al2O3 was maintained after Ni and/or Zn loading, but BET surface area and total pore volume of Ni-Zn/Al2O3 catalysts decreased significantly compared to Al2O3 support. Bimetallic Ni-Zn/Al2O3 catalysts were more effective than monometallic Ni/Al2O3 or Zn/Al2O3 catalyst. Bimetallic 15%Ni-5%Zn/Al2O3 catalyst generated the highest upgraded bio-oil yield at 44.64 wt% and produced the upgraded bio-oil with the highest hydrocarbon content at 50.12%. Physicochemical properties of upgraded bio-oils including heating value, water content and pH were significantly improved in comparison with raw bio-oil. The improved catalytic performance of bimetallic Ni-Zn/Al2O3 catalyst was associated with the synergistic effect of Ni and Zn on Al2O3 support. © 2017","Bio-oil; Catalysis; Hydrodeoxygenation; Ni-Zn/Al2O3; Pyrolysis; Upgraded bio-oil","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Catalysis; Catalysts; Fossil fuels; Hydrocarbons; Nickel; Pyrolysis; Sulfur compounds; Zinc; Bio oil; Catalytic performance; Crystalline structure; Environmental issues; Hydrocarbon content; Hydrodeoxygenation; Physicochemical property; Synergistic effect; Biofuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017032063

On industrial operating scale, multifunctional copper/zinc catalysts on various supporting substrates (e.g. CZA with alumina) are most commonly used due to their high selectivity and conversion. In this work, post-Hartree–Fock and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to assess the thermodynamics and to elucidate the pathway leading to the formation of methanol from CO2on realistic spinel-type tri-metallic materials. Firstly, a commercial-like Cu/ZnO/Al2O3was synthesised via co-precipitation and characterised to obtain the active sites’ structure for modelling. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area measurement, scanning/transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were performed. Subsequently, the Gibbs free energy, enthalpy, entropy and chemical equilibrium constants of the direct methanol synthesis and the competing reverse water–gas shift (RWGS) reaction at the temperatures of 25, 150, 200, 250 and 300 °C, and the pressures of 1, 20, 40, 60 and 100 bar were evaluated using ab initio quantum chemistry method CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVQZ. To investigate kinetics, a mechanistic pathway scheme with all established intermediates was constructed, whereas physical/chemical adsorption/desorption energies, geometries, barriers and rates for adsorbate elementary steps were calculated using plane-wave DFT. Results demonstrate that the formate precursor route predominates as the respective transition state activation energies are lower and, thus CH3OH is proposed to form through HCOO, H2COO, H2COOH, CH2O and CH3O species. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon dioxide; Copper–zinc–alumina; Heterogeneous catalyst; Hydrogenation; Methanol","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Calculations; Carbon dioxide; Catalyst selectivity; Computational chemistry; Density functional theory; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Equilibrium constants; Free energy; Gibbs free energy; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogenation; Methanol; Quantum chemistry; Scanning electron microscopy; Synthesis gas manufacture; X ray diffraction; Ab initio quantum chemistry; Carbon dioxide hydrogenation; Chemical equilibrium constant; Chemical process engineering; Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; Heterogeneous catalyst; Kinetics and thermodynamics; Renewable Energy industries; Activation energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013328484

A semi-continuous laboratory scale unit was developed to investigate the effects of temperature (300–500 °C), heating rate (10–30 °C.min−1) and cracking time (10–30 min) on the conversion of biomass in bio-oil. The main advantage of the proposed process is that a pure solvent is pumping through the reactor that contains the biomass, dispensing the use of biomass slurries. The yield of bio-oil ranged from 56% to 84%, depending on the experimental conditions. It was observed that an increase in working temperature led to an increase in the bio-oil production. Cracking time and heating rate variation had not shown a considerable effect on the conversion of biomass. The chemical profiles of bio-oil determined by GC/MS, indicate that at low temperature mainly sugar derivatives are produced, while at higher temperatures alcohols and phenolic are the majority compounds of the bio-oil. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bio-oil; Palm oil fiber; Supercritical ethanol; Thermoliquefaction","Biofuels; Biomass; Cracks; Ethanol; Heating rate; Oil shale; Organic solvents; Temperature; Bio oil; Chemical profiles; Effects of temperature; Experimental conditions; Heating rate variations; Supercritical ethanol; Thermoliquefaction; Working temperatures; Palm oil; alcohol; carbohydrate derivative; carbon; cellulose; hemicellulose; lignin; palm oil; alcohol; biofuel; element; palm oil; solvent; vegetable oil; biochemical composition; biofuel; biomass; chemical analysis; ethanol; gas chromatography; instrumentation; laboratory method; liquefaction; low temperature; mass spectrometry; oil production; slurry; straw; vegetable oil; Article; biomass liquefaction; decomposition; Elaeis; heating; low temperature; mass fragmentography; moisture; nonhuman; plant fiber; priority journal; thermoliquefaction; biomass; biotechnology; chemistry; dietary fiber; procedures; temperature; thermogravimetry; Elaeis; Biofuels; Biomass; Biotechnology; Dietary Fiber; Elements; Ethanol; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Plant Oils; Solvents; Temperature; Thermogravimetry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010015272

Development of microalgal biofuels from microalgae does not satisfy the economic feasibility of overwhelming capital investments and operations. Hence, high-value co-products have been produced through the extraction of a fraction of algae to improve the economics of a microalgae biorefinery. Examples of these high-value products are pigments, proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, vitamins and anti-oxidants, with applications in cosmetics, nutritional and pharmaceuticals industries. To promote the sustainability of this process, an innovative microalgae biorefinery structure is implemented through the production of multiple products in the form of high value products and biofuel.

The nanocomposites show a remarkable catalytic performance in ethanol, yielding up to 80%, predominantly ethyl levulinate, 5-ethoxymethylfurfural and 2-(diethoxymethyl)-5-(ethoxymethyl)furan. Fructose is the sugar substrate of choice, but the sulfonated composites are also able to convert di- and polymeric forms of fructose. Due to a lack of a glucose-to-fructose isomerization ability, the composites are unable to form the above products from the glucose resources (glucose and cellulose), ethyl glucoside being the dominant product from these feedstocks. The composite has a peculiar hierarchical pore architecture, which is stable on shelf in ambient for at least six years. While the mesoporosity facilitates entrance and fast transport (even of soluble poly-carbohydrates like inulin and cellulose polymers), the presence of microporosity is beneficial to attain fast sugar catalysis. Since the microporosity is associated with voids in the carbon phase (preferably pyrolyzed at 400 °C), composites with high carbon contents are preferred. Due to the fast transport, reactions with fructose in ethanol run in the chemical regime in the applied thermal conditions. Kinetic inspection of the reaction further clarifies the complex network of consequent and parallel reactions, demonstrating that HMF is the main precursor of humins, while the formation of EL directly from HMF should also be considered. While this observation corroborates the protective role of alcohols like ethanol, this work also concludes based on a series of reactions in different alcohols and water, that the presence of water plays a crucial role in the HMF-to-humins formation. While alcohols are known to stabilize HMF, the unprotected HMF is fairly stable in non-aqueous reaction circumstances like in tert-butanol solvent. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","5-ethoxymethylfurfural; Biofuels; Ethanolysis of fructose; Ethyl levulinate; Evaporation induced triconstituent co-assembly; Kinetic modeling; Sulfonated mesoporous silica-carbon nanocomposites","Carbon; Cellulose; Complex networks; Ethanol; Evaporation; Fructose; Glucose; Microporosity; Nanocatalysts; Nanocomposites; Self assembly; Silica; 5-ethoxymethylfurfural; Carbon nanocomposite; Ethanolysis; Ethyl levulinate; Kinetic modeling; Biofuels; Carbon; Catalysts; Ethanol; Evaporation; Silica; Sugars; Synthesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009107104

In this work, a thermodynamic study of glycerol dry reforming to produce syngas and subsequent ethanol production, as two-step process, was evaluated by means of the method of Gibbs free energy minimization. The effect of parameters such as reaction temperature, CO2/glycerol ratio (CGR), and pressure (P) on system performance was investigated. Reactions were simulated between 700-1,500 K and CGR range of 0-5, at 1 atm pressure. Calculations were performed with Aspen Plus 8.4, using Peng-Robinson thermodynamic method for properties estimation. Optimum conditions for syngas and ethanol production were determined, in order to prevent carbon deposition and methane formation. At temperatures above 900 K and CGR&lt;1, between 3 and 7 mole of H2/mole of glycerol can be generated. Results indicated that the addition of CO2 to the glycerol dry reforming reactor favored syngas and ethanol synthesis. The maximum yield obtained was 1 mole of ethanol per mole of glycerol at CGR≥2.

Currently, there are two main processes for bio-oil production: pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). The hydrothermal liquefaction is defined as biomass-to-liquid conversion route carried out in the hot compressed water with or without the presence of a catalyst. The major concern in HTL is the high pressure of the process which results in high capital cost of equipment. Thus, the process pressure and temperature should be reduced, but at a lower temperature, bio-oil yield is not high enough to make HTL an economical process for sustainable fuel production. In this research, we investigated the applicability of a nanocatalyst (nano-Ni/SiO2), an acid catalyst (synthesized zeolite), and an alkali catalyst (Na2CO3) to increase the bio-oil yield at low temperatures (210 °C, 230 °C, 250 °C). The major result of this work was higher bio-oil yields with the order of nano-Ni/SiO2 &gt; zeolite &gt; Na2CO3 in hydrothermal liquefaction of microalgae Nannochloropsis sp. The highest bio-oil yield (30.0 wt%) was obtained at 250 °C by using Nano-Ni/SiO2. Moreover, applying catalyst resulted in a decrease in the oxygen and the nitrogen contents of the bio-oil and consequently an increase in its heating value. The results of this research also suggest the possibility of nanocatalyst recovery for 2–3 times. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Bio-oil; Energy efficiency; Hydrothermal liquefaction; Nanocatalyst","Algae; Catalysts; Energy efficiency; Fossil fuels; Fuels; Liquefaction; Microorganisms; Nickel; Plants (botany); Sodium; Zeolites; Alternative energy source; Bio oil; Hot compressed water; Hydrothermal liquefactions; Lower temperatures; Nannochloropsis sp; Nano-catalyst; Synthesized zeolite; Biofuels; bioenergy; biofuel; biotechnology; catalysis; catalyst; energy efficiency; hydrothermal activity; liquefaction; microalga; nanoparticle; Nannochloropsis sp.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84987784802

Fractional conversion of both reactants was 65% or greater at temperatures above 120°C, and space time yields (STY) approached 140 and 15 g/L-cat/h for EA and EL, respectively, at 180°C (LHSV = 4.9 h-1). Two potential pathways for EL formation from levoglucosan were apparent, one with glucose and ethyl α-D-glucopyranoside as intermediates and the other with furfural. Adding metal functionality (Ru/H-ZSM5) resulted in the production of valerate biofuels (esters of carboxylic acids C3 or greater; e.g., pentanoic and hexanoic acid ethyl esters) and EA from the mixture in the presence of hydrogen. Conversions for LG and AA using Ru/H-ZSM5 were similar to H-ZSM5, but ethyl levulinate space time yield declined (∼5 g/L-cat/h) as valerate biofuel STY increased (∼10 g/L-cat/h) at an optimum temperature of 180°C. Our results indicate that valerate biofuels can be produced from levoglucosan (and possibly other sugars) in a continuous single stage, integrated process. However, due to low yields and coke formation, it is clear that ethanol/water ratios, pore size, and acid site type and density must be optimized when coupled with metal functionality for industrial application. © 2016 American Chemical Society.",,"Ascorbic acid; Esters; Ethanol; Fatty acids; Mesoporous materials; Mixtures; Pore size; Ruthenium; Catalytic esterification; Coke formation; Ethyl acetates; Fast pyrolysis oil; Fractional conversion; Glucopyranoside; Optimum temperature; Space time yield; Biofuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995900557

To model the combustion process, a computerized version of Shahed's quasi-dimensional multi-zone was used. Moreover, a FORTRAN-based code, which includes 12 species (CO2, H2O, N2, O2, CO, H, OH, H2, N, NO, O, Ar) associated with combustion products was employed to study the exergy analysis. The fuel injection amount was kept constant and five different fuel mixtures (B0, B5, B20, B50 and B100) were employed during a closed cycle. The computational in-cylinder pressures for neat diesel fuel were compared with those of calculated experimentally in the literature, and they showed a good agreement. Various rate and accumulative exergy components were computed with crank position at five fuel compositions. The results showed that as biodiesel increases by volume blends from 0% to 100%, the exergy efficiency increases slightly. The accumulative irreversibility decreased by 4.7%. From the viewpoint of the exergy analysis, for considered biodiesel blends the biodiesel fuel could be used as an alternative fuel without any considerable penalty on converting the fuel exergy to thermal energy in order to produce useful work.

Herein, we report a facile and template-free route to synthesize a series of heterogeneous nitrogen-containing alkyltriphosphonatemetal hybrids with enhancive Lewis acid and base sites, and their catalytic activity in converting biomass-derived carbonyl compounds to corresponding alcohols in 2-propanol. Particularly, a quantitative yield of furfuryl alcohol (FFA) was obtained from furfural (FUR) over organotriphosphate-zirconium hybrid (ZrPN) under mild conditions. The presence of Lewis basic sites adjacent to acid sites with an appropriate base/acid site ratio (1:0.7) in ZrPN significantly improved the yield of FFA. Mechanistic studies for the transformation of FUR to FFA with ZrPN in 2-propanol-d8 evidently indicate CTH reaction proceeding via a direct intermolecular hydrogen transfer route. It was also found that ZrPN could catalyze isomerization of C3-C6 aldoses to ketoses involving intramolecular hydrogen transfer in water. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","Acid-base catalyst; Biofuels; Heterogeneous catalysis; Hydrogen transfer; Mesoporous materials","Biofuels; Carbonyl compounds; Catalysis; Catalyst activity; Mesoporous materials; Acid-base catalysts; Catalytic transfer hydrogenation; Hydrogen transfer; Intermolecular hydrogen; Intramolecular hydrogen transfer; Mechanistic studies; Quantitative yields; Template-free route; Zirconium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015666810

The catalysts were prepared at different temperatures and characterized by elemental analysis, atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR).

The bioconversion of syngas to hydrogen via water-gas shift (WGS) reaction was carried out using the light-dependent microorganism Rhodospirillum rubrum and acetate as the sole carbon source. The RBF neural network was used to correlate exergetic outputs (normalized exergy destruction as well as rational and process exergetic efficiencies) to two exogenous input variables (culture agitation speed and syngas flow rate). The developed RBF model was interfaced with the proposed hybrid fuzzy clustering-ranking algorithm to simultaneously maximize the rational and process exergetic efficiencies and minimize the normalized exergy destruction. Moreover, the conventional fuzzy optimization algorithm was applied in order to assess the capability of the proposed approach over the existing methods for multi-objective optimization of complex biofuel production systems such as a continuous photobioreactor with respect to the sustainability and productivity issues. Once the development of the objective functions were carried out using RBF Neural Networks, the proposed algorithm was able to identify the optimum exergetically-sustainable operational parameters of carbon monoxide fermentation to biohydrogen with 20 clusters. This corresponded to the syngas flow rate of 13.68 mL/min and culture agitation speed of 348.62 rpm yielding the process exergetic efficiency of 16.46%, rational exergetic efficiency of 91.59%, and normalized exergy destruction of 2.14. The predicted optimum values by the proposed algorithm in this study were more suitable compared with the conventional fuzzy method. Therefore, the novel algorithm developed in this study may be a promising approach for navigation of the most cost-effective and environmental friendly operational parameters for fermentative hydrogen production from pilot and large scale photobioreactors. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Continuous photo-biohydrogen production; Fuzzy clustering-ranking algorithm; Multi-objective exergetic optimization; Radial bias function (RBF) neural network","Air navigation; Carbon monoxide; Complex networks; Cost effectiveness; Efficiency; Exergy; Fermentation; Functions; Fuzzy clustering; Fuzzy inference; Hydrogen production; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Parameter estimation; Photobioreactors; Radial basis function networks; Sustainable development; Synthesis gas; Water gas shift; Bio-hydrogen production; Continuous photobioreactor; Exergetic optimization; Fermentative hydrogen production; Fuzzy clustering-ranking algorithm; Fuzzy optimization algorithm; Radial basis function neural networks; Water gas shift (WGS) reaction; Clustering algorithms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994626828

Fuel characteristics and chemical structure of biochars and bio-oils have been investigated using standard fuel analysis and spectroscopic methods. Biochars were produced from poultry litter through both hydrothermal carbonization (sub-critical water, 175–250 °C) and pyrolysis over a temperature range between 250 and 500 °C. In comparison to hydrothermal carbonization, pyrolysis at lower temperatures produced biochar with greater energy yield due to the higher mass yield. Biochars obtained by both processes were comparable to coal. Hydrothermal liquefaction of poultry meal at different temperatures (200–325 °C) was conducted and compared to optimize its process conditions. Higher temperatures favored the formation of bio-crude oil, with a maximum yield of 35 wt.% at 300 °C. The higher heating values of bio-oils showed that bio-oil could be a potential source of synthetic fuels. However, elemental analysis demonstrated the high nitrogen content of bio-oils.

However, the conversion of this stable intermediate to MTHF required the combination of both hydrogen sources (the solvent and the H2 atmosphere) to achieve good yields. The reaction system with 2-propanol as solvent and Ni–Cu/Al2O3 as catalyst allowed full conversion of LA and a MTHF yield of 80 % after 20 h reaction time at 250 °C and 40 bar of H2 (at room temperature). The system showed the same catalytic activity at LA feed concentrations of 5 and up to 30 wt%, and also when high acetone concentration at the beginning of the reaction were added, which confirmed the potential industrial applications of this solvent/catalyst system. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The technique has been under development for a number of years, and yet, due to its complexity, it has always been difficult to generalize information about the optimal conditions. The main issue regards to the limited knowledge available from batch studies evaluating HTL by a finite number of process conditions in certain combinations. In this study, multivariate statistical methods were applied for investigation of HTL data available in the literature. The aim was to determine a set of generally valid rules for prediction of the output from the process (yields and the energy content) on the basis of relatively few process parameters. The results have shown that multivariate data analysis can be used to make predictions about HTL and increase our understanding of the process, despite the fact that the input data constituted a very broad spectrum of values. In general, biomass type and properties were the most significant parameters controlling both the obtained yields and the energy content in the produced biocrude. Regression models calculated for all groups of biomass were relatively poor, due to the lack of common trends. However, a number of statistically sound models were obtained for selected combinations of biomass and responses. The drawn conclusions not only supported the pre-understood axioms of HTL, but also indicated a number of new associations. It was shown that the overall conversion rates are governed by biomass properties and the applied heating velocities, while the amount of homogeneous catalyst and the reaction time control the distribution of the products between the water phase and the biocrude. The energy content in the biocrude produced from lignocellulose was dependent mostly on the biomass content and properties, and not the process conditions. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Biomass; Hydrothermal liquefaction; Multivariate data analysis; Optimization; Process conditions; Statistical assessment","Biomass; Data handling; Information analysis; Liquefaction; Optimization; Reaction rates; Regression analysis; Statistical methods; Homogeneous catalyst; Hydrothermal liquefactions; Multivariate data analysis; Multivariate statistical method; Optimal conditions; Process condition; Process parameters; Statistical assessment; Multivariant analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84971612066

The biofuel cell anode was prepared with the PQQ-dependent enzyme and designed using either a direct electron transfer (DET) architecture or via a mediated electron transfer (MET) configuration through a redox polymer, 1,1′-dimethylferrocene-modified linear polyethyleneimine (FcMe2-C3-LPEI). In the case of the bioanode containing the NAD+-dependent enzyme, only the mediated electron transfer mechanism was employed using an electropolymerized methylene green film to regenerate the NAD+ cofactor. Regardless of the enzyme being employed at the anode, a bilirubin oxidase-based biocathode prepared within a DET architecture afforded efficient electrocatalytic oxygen reduction in an ethanol/O2 biofuel cell. The power curves showed that DET-based bioanodes via the PQQ-dependent ADH still lack high current densities, whereas the MET architecture furnished maximum power density values as high as 226 ± 21 μW cm−2. Considering the complete membraneless enzymatic biofuel cell with the NAD+-dependent ADH-based bioanode, power densities as high as 111 ± 14 μW cm−2 were obtained.

The latter are obtained by thermal decomposition of ruthenium acetylacetonate in the pores. The catalysts showed excellent activities and selectivities at 100% cellulose conversion, exceeding those for the commercial Ru/C. High selectivities as well as activities are attributed to the influence of Fe3O4 on the Ru0/Ru4+ NPs.

High flammability of hydrogen gas in contact with air leads to difficult control of high pressurized hydrogen gas in large-scale systems. Meanwhile, molecular hydrogen production is a costly industrial process. Thus, hydrogenation study using hydrogen donor (H-donor) material as alternative for hydrogen gas could be useful in terms of cost and safety control. In this study, the potential of decalin and tetralin for use as hydrogen source was investigated in transfer hydrogenation of renewable lignin-derived phenolic compounds (phenol, o-cresol and guaiacol) and a simulated phenolic bio-oil over Pd/C and Pt/C catalysts. Reaction mechanisms of H-donor dehydrogenation and phenolics hydrogenation were studied. Catalytic activity of Pt/C for transfer hydrogenation of the phenolic compounds was higher than that of Pd/C at reaction temperature of 275 °C.

After the coking tests, the catalysts were characterized by elemental analysis (CHN) and thermogravimetric analysis using air and steam. 6NiO-BaAl presented the lowest coke removal rate with air. After that, the methodology was modified for ethanol and acetic acid, important model compounds used in studies of biofuels, steam reforming and bio-oil pyrolysis. All model compounds lead to carbon formation with the same chemical nature, as indicated by the temperature of the oxidation peak. So, the methodology can be used as a tool for selection of catalysts.

Experiments were carried out using two types of diesel/biodiesel blends (i.e., B5 and B20) at four concentrations (0, 30, 60 and 90 ppm) of the hybrid nanocatalyst, i.e., cerium oxide immobilized on amide-functionalized multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT). Furthermore, the exergy analysis was performed at five different loads and two engine speeds. The results obtained revealed that the exergetic parameters were profoundly influenced by engine speed and load. In general, increasing engine speed and load increased the magnitude of the destructed exergy. Moreover, the exergy efficiency increased by increasing engine load, while it decreased by elevating engine speed. However, the applied fuel blends had approximately similar exergetic efficiency and sustainability index. Interestingly, a remarkable reduction in emissions was obtained by incorporating the soluble catalyst nanoparticles to the diesel/biodiesel blends. Thus, it could be concluded that the diesel/biodiesel blends containing amide-functionalized MWCNTs-CeO2 catalyst might substitute the use of pure diesel fuel without any unfavorable change in the exergetic performance parameters of the DI engines. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Diesel engine; Diesel/biodiesel blends; Exergy destruction; Exergy efficiency; Hybrid nano-catalyst; Sustainability index","Amides; Carbon; Catalysts; Diesel fuels; Efficiency; Engines; Exergy; Fuels; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN); Speed; Sustainable development; Yarn; Exergetic efficiency; Exergetic performance; Exergy destructions; Exergy efficiencies; Functionalized MWCNTs; Nano-catalyst; Soluble catalysts; Sustainability index; Diesel engines; biofuel; catalyst; diesel engine; energy efficiency; equipment; exergy; nanoparticle; performance assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960154513

In general, a significant difference was found between the exergetic values of the process using the conventional exergy and eco-exergy approaches. Overall, the eco-exergy concept showed to be a more appropriate approach for analysing and optimizing energy conversion systems including living organisms due to the incorporation of the work of the genetic information embodied in the genomes of microorganisms. The lowest overall normalized exergy destruction was found to be 49.96 kJ/kJ Ac + EtOH and 40.54 kJ/kJ Ac + EtOH at initial pressure of 1.8 atm using the conventional exergy and eco-exergy concepts, respectively.

Cattle manure, a waste generated in surplus amounts from the feedlot, has always been a chief environmental concern. This study is focused on identifying the candidacy of horse manure as a next generation feedstock for biofuel production through supercritical water gasification. The horse manure was gasified in supercritical water to examine the effects of temperature (400-600 °C), biomass-to-water ratio (1:5 and 1:10) and reaction time (15-45 min) at a pressure range of 23-25 MPa. The horse manure and resulting biochar were characterized through carbon-hydrogen-nitrogen-sulfur (CHNS), inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The effects of alkali catalysts such as NaOH, Na2CO3 and K2CO3 at variable concentrations (1-2 wt%) were investigated to maximize the hydrogen yields. Supercritical water gasification of horse manure with 2 wt% Na2CO3 at 600 °C and 1:10 biomass-to-water ratio for 45 min revealed maximum hydrogen yields (5.31 mmol/g), total gas yields (20.8 mmol/g) with greater carbon conversion efficiency (43.1%) and enhanced lower heating value of gas products (2920 kJ/Nm3). The manure-derived biochars generated at temperatures higher than 500 °C also demonstrated higher thermal stability (weight loss &lt;34%) and larger carbon content (&gt;70 wt%) suggesting their application in enhancing soil fertility and carbon sequestration. The results propose that supercritical water gasification could be a proficient remediation technology for horse manure to generate hydrogen-rich gas products. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Alkali catalyst; Biochar; Feed concentration; Horse manure; Reaction time; Supercritical water; Temperature","Agriculture; Biomass; Calorific value; Catalysts; Fertilizers; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Gasification; Human reaction time; Hydrogen production; Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; Mass spectrometry; Municipal solid waste; Nitrogen plasma; Remediation; Scanning electron microscopy; Sewage sludge; Sodium; Temperature; Thermogravimetric analysis; Alkali catalysts; Bio chars; Feed concentration; Horse manure; Supercritical water; Manures; biofuel; carbon; hydrogen; nitrogen; potassium carbonate; sodium carbonate; sodium hydroxide; sulfur; water; biochar; charcoal; manure; sewage; biofuel; carbon sequestration; catalyst; concentration (composition); horse; manure; soil fertility; supercritical flow; temperature effect; Article; biofuel production; biomass; catalyst; catalytic supercritical water gasification; chemical procedures; concentration (parameters); gasification; horse; infrared spectroscopy; manure; mass spectrometry; pressure; priority journal; Raman spectrometry; reaction time; reactor; scanning electron microscopy; soil fertility; temperature sensitivity; thermogravimetry; thermostability; valorization; animal; procedures; sewage; temperature; Bos; Equidae; Animals; Carbon; Charcoal; Horses; Hydrogen; Manure; Nitrogen; Pressure; Sewage; Sulfur; Temperature; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979462464

It is therefore crucial to have a surface-level understanding of the adsorption of the key species in a reaction in order to design active and selective catalysts. Here, we study the adsorption of guaiacol on Fe (110) and Pd (111) using dispersion-corrected density functional theory calculations as both of these metals are of interest as hydrodeoxygenation catalysts for the conversion of bio-oils to useable biofuels. Both vertical (via the oxygen functional groups) and horizontal (via the aromatic ring) adsorption configurations were examined and the resulting adsorption and molecular distortion energies showed that the vertical sites were only physisorbed while the horizontal sites were chemisorbed on both metal surfaces. A comparison of guaiacol's horizontal adsorption on Fe (110) and Pd (111) showed that guaiacol had a stronger adsorption on Pd (111) while the Fe (110) surface distorted the C-O bonds to a greater degree. Electronic analyses on the horizontal systems showed that the greater adsorption strength for guaiacol on Pd (111) was likely due to the greater charge transfer between the aromatic ring and the surface Pd atoms. Additionally, the greater distortion of the C-O bonds in adsorbed guaiacol on Fe (110) is likely due to the greater degree of interaction between the oxygen and surface Fe atoms. Overall, our results show that the Fe (110) surface has a greater degree of interaction with the functional groups and the Pd (111) surface has a greater degree of interaction with the aromatic ring. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

PdNPs were confined with multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) dispersions to form black suspensions and these inks were dropcast onto glassy carbon electrodes. Different nanoparticle sizes were synthesized and investigated upon oxygen reduction capacities (onset potential and electrocatalytic current densities) under O2 saturated conditions at varying pH values. Strong evidence of O2 diffusion limitation was demonstrated. In order to overcome oxygen concentration and diffusion limitations in solution, we used a gas diffusion layer to create a PdNP-based air-breathing cathode, which delivered-1.5 mA cm-2 at 0.0 V with an onset potential of 0.4 V. This air-breathing cathode was combined with a specially designed phenanthrolinequinone/glucose dehydrogenase-based anode to form a complete glucose/O2 hybrid bio-fuel cell providing an open circuit voltage of 0.554 V and delivering a maximal power output of 184 ± 21 μW cm-2 at 0.19 V and pH 7.0. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Ascorbic acid; Biofuels; Biological fuel cells; Carbon nanotubes; Cathodes; Diffusion; Diffusion in gases; Electrolytic reduction; Fuel cells; Glass membrane electrodes; Glucose; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN); Nanoparticles; Open circuit voltage; Oxygen; Suspensions (fluids); Synthesis (chemical); Yarn; Air breathing cathode; Diffusion limitations; Electrocatalytic current; Glassy carbon electrodes; Hybrid biofuel cells; Oxygen concentrations; Oxygen reduction reaction; Saturated conditions; Electrodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84971330866

Following the success of organic-inorganic hybrid mesoporous silicas, a wide range of analogous hybrid metal phosphonates have been designed. This has opened up a wide diversity of open framework porous nanomaterials, which show excellent catalytic activities in many organic transformations that are not possible with their corresponding inorganic counterparts.

The first part rationalizes the active, selective, and stable performance of supported MgO catalysts in the vapor phase condensation of propanal, which is maximized upon the mechanochemical activation of a siliceous USY zeolite (Si/Al=405) with 1wt.% Mg(OH)2. Infrared spectroscopic studies of the interaction with CO and CO2, reveal that the presence of 4-coordinate Mg likely localized in framework defects on the zeolite surface, and the avoidance of MgO formation are key to moderating the basicity with respect to the bulk oxide. The second part compares the best-performing MgO/USY catalyst with the most promising previously reported catalysts: K-grafted USY and Ca-hydroxyapatite. A detailed kinetic analysis of the conversion of individual bio-oil constituents (propanal or acetic acid) and binary mixtures thereof (propanal with acetic acid, methanol, or water) provides insights into the reaction network, rate-limiting steps, and relative surface coverage of reactants and products over each catalyst. This enables the anticipation of the aldol-condensation performance in simulated and real bio-oil mixtures. A significant inhibitory effect is observed in the presence of acetic acid, but the K-grafted USY zeolite is found to preserve its stability and retain the highest activity due to the weaker adsorption of acidic compounds. The presence of water has no pronounced effect on the observed reaction rates, while methanol is found to selectively poison Ca-hydroxyapatite due to the competitive adsorption on the active sites. The attained results under real bio-oil conditions demonstrate the effectiveness of this simplified approach to bridge the complexity gap between the study of model compounds and real bio-oil. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..","Basic zeolites; Bio-oil deoxygenation; Hydroxyapatite; Mechanochemical activation; Realistic feeds","Acetic acid; Binary mixtures; Calcium; Carbon dioxide; Catalysts; Chemical activation; Complex networks; Condensation; Condensation reactions; Grafting (chemical); Hydroxyapatite; Ketones; Magnesia; Methanol; Mixtures; Organic acids; pH; Reaction rates; Spectroscopic analysis; Surface defects; Aldol condensation; Basic zeolites; Competitive adsorption; Deoxygenations; Infrared spectroscopic studies; Mechano-chemical activation; Rate-limiting steps; Solid base catalysts; Biofuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84948136946

This work aims to design a microwave-assisted cascade process for a full biomass valorisation cycle. GVL (γ-valerolactone), a renewable green solvent, has been used in aqueous acidic solution to achieve complete biomass lignin extraction. After lignin precipitation, the levulinic acid (LA)-rich organic fraction was hydrogenated, which regenerated the starting solvent for further biomass delignification. This process does not requires a purification step because GVL plays the dual role of solvent and product, while the reagent (LA) is a product of biomass delignification. In summary, this bio-refinery approach to lignin extraction is a cascade protocol in which the solvent loss is integrated into the conversion cycle, leading to simplified methods for biomass valorisation. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Bio-refinery; Biomass; Lignin; Microwaves; γ-valerolactone","biofuel; gamma-valerolactone; lactone; levulinic acid; lignin; solvent; biomass; chemistry; hydrogenation; hydrolysis; microwave radiation; synthesis; Biofuels; Biomass; Hydrogenation; Hydrolysis; Lactones; Levulinic Acids; Lignin; Microwaves; Solvents",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84968542304

The problems associated with global warming due to rising atmospheric greenhouse gas levels and scarcity of fossil fuels make it imperative to reduce our heavy dependency on fossil fuels. These reasons forced countries throughout the world to search for new fuel alternatives. Biofuel have gathered considerable attention due to their inherent benefits, like lower greenhouse gas emission, renewability, and sustainability. Commercially, biofuels are produced from vegetable oils, animal fats, and carbohydrates by using transesterification and fermentation. However, biofuel production suffers from high production costs and other technical barriers. Considering the environmental and economic issues, use of nanotechnology seems to be a viable solution. Nanoparticles have a number of interesting properties for the production of second-generation ethanol or transesterification of oils and fats to yield biodiesel. It is advantageous for recovery and reuse of catalysts. The present review discusses the role of nanotechnology in the production of bioethanol and biodiesel. Moreover, applications of nanoparticles for the production of biodiesel and second-generation ethanol with special reference to enzyme immobilization and chemical nano-catalysis have been described. © 2016 by De Gruyter.","biodiesel; biofuel; ethanol; immobilization; nanotechnology; renewable resources","Biodiesel; Bioethanol; Biofuels; Enzyme immobilization; Ethanol; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Nanoparticles; Nanotechnology; Radioactive waste vitrification; Sustainable development; Transesterification; Atmospheric greenhouse; Biofuel production; Economic issues; Production cost; Renewable resource; Second generation; Technical barriers; Viable solutions; Oils and fats",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964570091

In this study, the feasibility of 5-HMF sequestration was investigated using granular activated carbon (GAC) as the adsorbent. RESULTS: Equilibria for the 5-HMF adsorption onto GAC were derived. Positive isosteric heat values showed the reaction was exothermic and favored at low temperature. The pseudo-second order dynamics and the estimated activation energy, 227.4 kJ mol-1, implied that the removal mechanism would be chemical adsorption. The adsorption was not interfered with by the presence of sugar and sugar compounds were not adsorbed onto GAC. CONCLUSION: Batch and column tests on dilute acid hydrolyzate of red algal biomass showed that GAC adsorption would be a feasible option for sequestration of 5-HMF in hydrolyzate for the biofuel and biorefinery industries. © 2015 Society of Chemical Industry © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.","Adsorption; Algae; Biomass; Char; Detoxification; Pretreatment","Activated carbon; Activation energy; Algae; Biomass; Carbon; Detoxification; Dyes; Granular materials; Refining; 5 hydroxymethyl furfurals; Char; Chemical adsorption; Granular activated carbons; Low temperatures; Pre-Treatment; Pseudo second order; Removal mechanism; Adsorption; 5 hydroxymethylfurfural; activated carbon; adsorbent; biofuel; sugar; adsorption; Article; biomass; chemical reaction kinetics; dynamics; feasibility study; low temperature; nonhuman; red alga",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960811716

In this work, the fabrication of a new material capable of acting as an abiotic anode for the electrooxidation of glucose was developed. The material is composed of electrospun carbon fibers containing gold nanoparticles formed insitu from a polyacrylonitrile (PAN) solution with HAuCl4. This approach allows the pre-reduction of the gold salt by PAN under mild conditions without the need for extra energy and leads to very stable carbon-gold bonding with well-dispersed AuNPs, not previously reported. The gold-modified carbon fibers (Au@CFs) were characterized by SEM, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, XRD, and electrochemical analysis. The Au@CF electrodes showed electrochemical activity toward glucose oxidation in alkaline media. Combined to a bilirubin oxidase modified biocathode (BOD@CFs), the resulting hybrid glucose biofuel cell showed open-circuit voltage and power density values of 0.75V and 65μWcm-2, respectively, which remained intact after 3weeks. Fueling the future: A new strategy is used to prepare Au metal nanoparticle catalysts incorporated insitu in electrospun carbon nanofibers for the electrooxidation of glucose in hybrid glucose biofuel cells (h-GBFCs).

Activated carbon (AC) was prepared maintaining 500 °C for 1 h and steam activated at optimised values of activation time 1.5 h and temperature 350 °C. Carbonaceous support was impregnated with KOH at different AC/KOH ratios. The transesterification process was optimized and significant parameters affecting the biodiesel yield was identified by Taguchi method considering four parameters viz. reaction time, reaction temperature, methanol to oil ratio and catalyst loading. The physicochemical properties of Hevea brasiliensis methyl ester (HBME) were examined experimentally at optimised condition and found to meet the global American standards for testing and materials (ASTM). The optimum condition observed to yield 89.81% of biodiesel were: reaction time 60 min, reaction temperature 55 °C, catalyst loading 3.5wt% and methanol to oil ratio 15:1. Contribution factor revealed that among four parameters considered, catalyst loading and methanol to oil ratio have more prominent effect on biodiesel yield.

The hemicellulose feed underwent hydrolysis and consecutive dehydration to produce furfural over ZSM-5 catalyst. Subsequently, the formed furfural with 2-propanol performed tandem conversion to GVL over Au/ZrO2 catalyst combined with ZSM-5.

Several catalysts have been prepared in this view by varying the metal content. The organic yield obtained with CuNi2Ru1@ CsPW catalyst (ca. 30 wt.%) is two times higher than the one found for the bimetallic CuRu1@CsPW and close to the activity of CuRu2@CsPWmaterial. In the batch reactor, a high yield of good quality biofuel is obtained. However, the catalyst reusability is compromised due to high thermal treatment required for the charcoal removal fromthe surface of the materialwhich causes catalyst degradation and particles sintering.Moreover, the accumulation of ashes on the catalyst surface decreases the active species accessibility. To avoid the contamination of the catalystwith ashes and charcoal, hydrotreatment process is combined with slowpyrolysis of biomass. Indeed, the pyrolysis oil resulted from thermal decomposition of biomass is treated in a fixed bed reactor containing CuNi2Ru1@CsPW. In this case, the catalytic activity is low, only 15 wt.% of biofuel is obtained, but the activity is stable even after four catalytic cycles. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Biofuel; Biomass; Heteropolyoxometalates; Hydrodeoxygenation; Nanoparticles; Ruthenium","Batch reactors; Bioconversion; Biofuels; Biomass; Catalysts; Charcoal; Chemical reactors; Decomposition; Nanoparticles; Pyrolysis; Reusability; Ruthenium; Biomass conversion; Catalyst degradation; Catalyst reusability; Catalyst surfaces; Continuous reactors; Hetero-polyoxometalates; Hydrodeoxygenation; Physicochemical techniques; Catalyst activity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945206772

Lignocellulose is the cheapest and most abundant source of biomass and consequently has been widely considered as a source for liquid fuel. However, despite ongoing efforts, cellulosic biofuels are still far from commercial realization, one of the major bottlenecks being the hydrolysis of cellulose into simpler sugars. Inspired by the structural and functional modularity of cellulases used by many organisms for the breakdown of cellulose, we propose to mimic the cellulose binding domain (CBD) and the catalytic domain of these proteins by small molecular entities. Multiple copies of these mimics could subsequently be tethered together to enhance hydrolytic activity. In this work, we take the first step toward achieving this goal by applying computational approaches to the design of efficient, cost-effective mimetics of the CBD. The design is based on low molecular weight peptides that are amenable to large-scale production. We provide an optimized design of four short (i.e., ∼18 residues) peptide mimetics based on the three-dimensional structure of a known CBD and demonstrate that some of these peptides bind cellulose as well as or better than the full CBD. The structures of these peptides were studied by circular dichroism and their interactions with cellulose by solid phase NMR. Finally, we present a computational strategy for predicting CBD/peptide-cellulose binding free energies and demonstrate its ability to provide values in good agreement with experimental data. Using this computational model, we have also studied the dissociation pathway of the CBDs/peptides from the surface of cellulose. © 2015 American Chemical Society.",,"Binding energy; Bins; Biofuels; Biomimetics; Cellulose; Computational methods; Cost effectiveness; Design; Dichroism; Peptides; Proteins; Scales (weighing instruments); Cellulose binding domains; Computational approach; Computational strategy; Dissociation pathways; Functional modularity; Large scale productions; Low-molecular-weight peptides; Three-dimensional structure; Structural design; Binding; Cellulose; Degradation; Peptides; cellulose; peptide; amino acid sequence; biomimetics; carbon nuclear magnetic resonance; catalysis; chemistry; circular dichroism; hydrolysis; metabolism; molecular dynamics; molecular genetics; molecular weight; Amino Acid Sequence; Biomimetics; Carbon-13 Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Catalysis; Cellulose; Circular Dichroism; Hydrolysis; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Molecular Sequence Data; Molecular Weight; Peptides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84955473387

Here, we perform ionic liquid ([BMIM]Cl) based catalytic conversion of Ricinus communis (Castor leaves/tree mixtures) under the influence of microwave radiations with CuCl2 as a catalyst in a microwave reactor. The lignocellulosic substrate is first depolymerized into glucose, which then converts to HMF that further dissociates into levulinc acid (LA) and formic acid (FA). We focus on experimental determination of the optimal water addition and microwave heating profile (temperature and pressure) for maximizing the HMF yield from Ricinus communis in [BMIM]Cl aided with CuCl2 catalyst. Our kinetic model along with a Power Law model (for the dehydration of HMF and conversion of HMF to LA) and Biphasic Model (for lignocellulose hydrolysis) for quantifying the temporal dynamics of glucose and HMF production uses our understanding of the crucial role that water plays in determining the product distribution. The effect of pre-treatment on the lignocellulosic substrate has also been analyzed using FESEM (pore structure, size and density), BET (pore-surface analysis), Particle Size Analyser and XRD (extent of crystallinity). The microwave reactor helps align the dipoles in the electromagnetic field created by the combination of ionic liquid and microwave radiation, thus reducing the total reaction time drastically to 35 - 50 min, while our novel water addition strategy allows us to manipulate the production distribution for maximizing the conversion of lignocelluloses to HMF via glucose.

Moreover, although cobalt oxide crystals have been reported with electrocatalytic activity, studies on square-like nano cobalt oxide are very few, and it has not been reported as an oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst, let alone used in biofuel cells. Thus, herein, square-like nano cobalt oxide anchored on nitrogen-doped graphene (NG/Co-NS), carbon nanotube (CNT/Co-NS) and carbon black (CB/Co-NS) were prepared by a one-pot hydrothermal method for the application as an ORR catalyst in microbial fuel cells (MFC). The results indicated that NG/Co-NS exhibited outstanding ORR activity with a more positive on-set potential (-0.05 V vs. Ag/AgCl) and higher limiting diffusion current (5.8 mA cm-2 at -0.8 V) than CB/Co-NS and CNT/Co-NS, attributed to the synergistic catalytic effect of NG and Co-NS. Besides, in MFC tests, the maximum power density of NG/Co-NS was improved significantly to 713.6 mW m-2, which was 24.9% higher than Pt/C (571.3 mW m-2, 0.2 mg Pt cm-2). In addition, the internal resistance of MFCs with NG/Co-NS was lower than CB/Co-NS and CNT/Co-NS, which favored the electricity generation performance. Thus, NG/Co-NS was promising material for an alternative oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalyst of Pt/C in MFCs. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Biofuels; Biological fuel cells; Carbon black; Carbon nanotubes; Catalysts; Cobalt; Cobalt deposits; Doping (additives); Electrocatalysts; Electrolytic reduction; Fuel cells; Graphene; Nitrogen; Platinum; Platinum alloys; Yarn; Catalytic efficiencies; Electricity generation; Electrocatalytic activity; Limiting diffusion current; Maximum power density; Nitrogen doped graphene; Oxygen reduction reaction; Reduced graphene oxides; Microbial fuel cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973332937

The synthesis, bimetallic nanostructures and catalytic properties were thoroughly characterized by ultraviolet-visible light spectrophotometry, transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis and electrochemistry. The 8 ± 2 nm Au@PtNPs contained 24 ± 1 mol% Pt and 76 ± 1 mol% Au corresponding to an atomically thin Pt shell. Electrochemical data clearly show that the active surface is dominated by Pt with a specific surface area above 45 m2 per gram of Pt. Interactions with the Au core increase the activity of the Pt shell by up to 55% and improve catalytic selectivity compared to pure Pt. The Au@Pt NPs show exciting catalytic activity in electrooxidation of sustainable fuels (i.e. formic acid, methanol and ethanol), and selective hydrogenation of benzene derivatives.

The nanocatalysts were characterized by BET surface area measurements, electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) and showed the NSs had a helical and mesoporous structure. The Ni and Ru decorated NSs showed good metal dispersity at the NS surface. Catalytic HDO conversion of phenol (model bio-oil compound) using NS were compared to conventional alumina (Al2O3) and silica (SiO2) gel catalyst supports. Ni-Al2O3 was easily deactivated in the presence of water while the Ni-NS catalysts performed very well irrespective of water being present. An increase in Ni loading (up to 50%) increased the Ni-NS activity while the high loading resulted in a detrimental effect on the activity of silica gel based catalysts. Ru based catalysts showed better activity and conversion on phenol HDO than Ni based catalysts, even in the presence of water. Ponderosa pine pyrolysis bio-oil was fractionated into water-soluble (WS) and water-insoluble (WI) fractions. The bio-oil WI fraction was first hydrocracked to lower its molar mass and then HDO treated with Ni-NS to successfully form cycloalkanes products.

Calcium-based catalyst has attracted much attention in deoxygenation process due its relatively high capacity in removing oxygenated compounds in the form of CO2 and CO under decarboxylation and decarbonylation reaction, respectively. In the present study, deoxygenation of triolein was investigated using Ca(OH)2 nanocatalyst derived from low cost natural waste shells. The Ca(OH)2 nanocatalyst was prepared via integration techniques between surfactant treatment (anionic and non-ionic) and wet sonochemical effect. Results showed that sonochemically assisted surfactant treatment has successfully enhanced the physicochemical properties of Ca(OH)2 nanocatalyst in terms of nano-particle sizes (∼50 nm), high surface area (∼130 m2 g-1), large porosity (∼18.6 nm) and strong basic strength. The presence of superior properties from surfactant treated Ca(OH)2 nanocatalysts rendered high deoxygenation degree, which are capable of producing high alkane and alkene selectivity in chain length of n-C17 (high value of C17/(n-C17 + n-C18) ratio = 0.88). Furthermore, both Ca(OH)2-EG and Ca(OH)2-CTAB nanocatalysts showed high reactivity with 47.37% and 44.50%, respectively in total liquid hydrocarbon content of triolein conversion with high H/C and low O/C ratio. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The AE-Cu/SiO2 catalyst was prepared via the ammonia evaporation method and showed a 95.5% yield for 2-methylfuran (a promising fuel additive) because of the cooperative effects of surface Cu0, Cu+ species and acid sites, which respectively stemmed from the reduction of highly dispersed CuO species, copper species that fiercely interacted with the support SiO2, and the special structure. The ammonia evaporation method favored the formation of a copper phyllosilicate phase with a lamellar structure, which could provide a large number of Cu nanoparticles and acid sites and further improve the activity and selectivity. Crucially, the stability of the AE-Cu/SiO2 catalyst (&gt;210 h) was also significantly improved due to the enhanced copper-silicon interactions, which could immobilize copper particles and resist the fast transmigration (aggregation and loss) of copper particles in the thermal treatment process. In contrast, the CP-Cu/SiO2 catalyst was synthesized via the conventional precipitation method and presented poor activity and stability toward 2-methylfuran because of large copper particles, severe aggregation and a loss of copper species during reaction. Compared with the conventional CP-Cu/SiO2 catalyst, the use of the AE-Cu/SiO2 catalyst in the synthesis of the biofuel 2-methylfuran could not only improve the yield of the desired product, but also decrease by at least 20 °C the reaction temperature which is propitious for prolonging the lifetime of the Cu/SiO2 catalyst. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,"Ammonia; Biofuels; Catalysts; Copper; Evaporation; Fuel additives; Nanoparticles; Precipitation (chemical); Silicon oxides; Synthesis (chemical); Ammonia evaporation; Catalytic performance; Co-operative effects; Conventional precipitation; Efficient catalysts; Reaction temperature; Special structure; Thermal treatment process; Agglomeration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957922036

In this study, we chemically integrated acid-base bifunctionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs-SO3H-NH2) and a macroporous polymer foam poly(HIPE) (PH) matrix that is derived from water-in-oil (W/O) high internal phase emulsion (HIPE) templating. After the subsequent sulfonation process, a SPHs@MSNs-SO3H-NH2 catalyst with a hierarchical porous structure and bifunctional sites was prepared and used for the highly efficient synthesis of top value-added 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) from renewable cellulose in an ionic liquid (i.e., 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, [EMIM]Cl) based system. Evaluation of the catalytic activity revealed that the designed macropores were favorable for ready mass transfer, whereas the high surface area for active-site anchoring provided by the mesoporous structure was beneficial in enhancing the catalyst performance. A theoretical study also suggested that acidic and basic active sites synergistically work for the transformation reaction. Under the optimized conditions, a remarkably high HMF yield (44.5 %) was obtained efficiently. Furthermore, the as-prepared catalyst was recycled in four consecutive cycles with a total loss of only 4.9 % activity. Sweet success: Hierarchically macro-/mesoporous polymer foam has been successfully synthesized and used for the sustainable production of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF; see figure) from renewable cellulose.

The potential competition between the hydrogenation and the catalyzed-conversion of HMF and furfural has been investigated with Pd/C and Amberlyst 70 as the catalysts at 170°C in various solvents. In water, the hydrogenation of HMF or the derivatives of HMF could take place, but the acid-catalyzed conversion of HMF to the diketones (2,5-hexanedione) was the dominant reaction pathway. On the contrary, with ethanol as the solvent, the full hydrogenation of HMF to 2,5-tetrahydrofurandimethanol was the dominant route, and the acid-catalyzed routes became insignificant. The efficiency for hydrogenation of HMF was much higher in ethanol than in water. As for furfural, its hydrogenation proceeded more efficiently in the polar solvents (i.e. ethanol, diethyl ether) than in non-polar solvents (i.e. toluene): a polar solvent tended to favor the hydrogenation of the furan ring in furfural over that of the carbonyl group in the same furfural. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,"Aldehydes; Aromatic compounds; Catalysis; Ethanol; Furfural; Hydrogenation; Ketones; Organic pollutants; Reaction kinetics; Solvents; 5 hydroxymethyl furfurals; Acid-catalyzed conversions; Carbonyl groups; Catalyzed conversion; Non-polar solvents; Polar solvents; Reaction pathways; Value-added chemicals; Organic solvents",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84955284626

The doubly-promoted Fe-Cu-K-Si-Al catalyst achieved higher CO and CO2 conversions than the Fe-Cu-K catalyst and singly-promoted Fe-Cu-K-Al and Fe-Cu-K-Si catalysts. The CO and CO2 conversions of the syngas with 54% H2/10% CO/29% CO2/7% N2 over the doubly-promoted catalyst were 88.3% and 25.2%, respectively, compared to 81.8% and 18.5% for the Fe-Cu-K catalyst. In this case, the C5+ selectivity of the doubly-promoted catalyst was 71.9%, which was slightly lower than 75.5% for the Fe-Cu-K catalyst. The CO2 was converted to hydrocarbons using the doubly-promoted catalyst when the CO2/(CO + CO2) ratio was higher than 0.35 for H2-balanced syngas at H2/(2CO + 3CO2) = 1.0, and 0.5 for H2-deficient syngas at H2/(2CO + 3CO2) = 0.5.

X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy were applied to elucidate the formation of the high-quality nanocatalysts. Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) and CHNS analyses showed that the bio-crude yield and carbon/oxygen ratios increase as the amount of UNCFO increases, reaching a peak value of 32% at 1.25 wt% (a 9% increase when compared to the catalyst-free yield). The bio-crude is mainly composed of fatty acids, alcohols, ketones, phenol and benzene derivatives, and hydrocarbons. Their relative abundance changes as a function of catalyst concentration. FTIR spectroscopy and vibrating sample magnetometry revealed that the as-produced bio-crudes are free of iron species, which accumulate in the generated bio-chars. Our findings also indicate that the energy recovery values via the HTL process are sensitive to the catalyst loading, with a threshold loading of 1.25 wt%. GC-MS studies show that the UNCFO not only influences the chemical nature of the resulting bio-crudes and bio-chars, but also the amount of fixed carbons in the solid residues. The detailed molecular characterization of the bio-crudes and bio-chars catalyzed by UNCFO represents the first systematic study reported using UFMA. This study brings forth new avenues to advance the highly-pure bio-crude production employing active, heterogeneous catalyst materials that are recoverable and recyclable for continuous thermochemical reactions. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.",,"Carbon; Chromatography; Fatty acids; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Gas chromatography; Iron compounds; Ketones; Mass spectrometry; X ray diffraction; Benzene derivatives; Catalyst concentration; Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopies; Heterogeneous catalyst; Hydrothermal liquefactions; Molecular characterization; Thermochemical reactions; Vibrating sample magnetometry; Catalysts; biofuel; magnetite; metal nanoparticle; biomass; catalysis; chemistry; infrared spectroscopy; mass fragmentography; metabolism; microalga; ultrastructure; Biofuels; Biomass; Catalysis; Ferrosoferric Oxide; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Metal Nanoparticles; Microalgae; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945317046

Fossil fuels have been a major contributing factor for greenhouse gas production, leading to global warming. Hence, biofuels have been greatly researched in hopes to replace fossil fuels. One remarkable biofuel producer is microalgae, due to their high biomass productions, high cellular lipid accumulation, as well as the ability to sequester carbon dioxide from waste gas and remove pollutants from wastewater. Integration of wastewater as the medium for algal cultivation offers a green and cost-effective way for sustainable biofuel production. The zero-cost palm oil mill effluent (POME) in Malaysia will be an option for microalgae cultivation due to the high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus. Microalgae are able to survive in wastewater by utilizing the nutrients for growth. This has the potential to achieve economical microalgae production for bioenergy, while promoting environmental sustainability.

Ni/Al2O3 provided the highest activity, whereas Cu/Al2O3 was the most selective, reaching a 75% MTHF yield at 250 C after 24h reaction time. Synergetic effects were observed when bimetallic Ni-Cu/Al2O3 catalysts were used, reaching a 56% MTHF yield in 5h at 250 C for the optimum Ni/Cu ratio. Remarkably, these high yields were obtained using non-noble metal-based catalysts and 2-propanol as the solvent.

In this work, the influence of the carbon support type (carbon nanotube [CNT], activated carbon [AC] and graphitic carbon black [GCB]) and the addition of Pt (1 wt.%, 1.5 wt.% and 2 wt.%) and ZnO (10 wt.%) to Ni10/CNT (10 wt.% Ni) are studied in steam reforming of ethanol (SRE) at low temperatures (≤450°C). The prepared CNT-based catalysts were characterized by nitrogen physisorption, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) and energy filtered transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM) analyses. Ni supported on CNTs was found to be highly active for SRE compared to other conventional carbon supported catalysts. The promotional effect of Pt in the Ni10Ptx/CNT catalysts was found to be unexpectedly insignificant in terms of ethanol conversion, hydrogen production and selectivity. By contrast, the hybrid (ZnO)10Ni10/CNT catalyst showed superior catalytic performance below 450°C with high H2 selectivity and low CO selectivity compared to all other CNT-based catalysts. The Ni10/CNT catalyst undergoes rapid deactivation compared to the ZnO promoted Ni10/CNT due to the large amounts of carbon deposition on the catalyst. The ZnO promoted Ni10/CNT catalyst enhances the hydrogen production and reduces the carbon formation, making the catalyst attractive for the SRE reaction. © 2015 by De Gruyter.","CNT; hydrogen production; Ni; ZnO",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84944446638

All the samples contained a metal-loading of 20 wt% and with an initial M/P mole ratio of 1, and they were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 sorption, H2-TPR and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Metal phosphide nanocatalysts were tested in a high pressure continuous flow reactor for the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of a methyl ester blend containing methyl oleate (C17H33-COO-CH3) as main component (70%). This mixture constitutes a convenient surrogate of triglycerides present in vegetable oils, and following catalytic hydrotreating yields mainly n-alkanes. The results of the catalytic assays indicate that Ni2P/SBA-15 catalyst presents the highest ester conversion, whereas the transformation rate is about 20% lower for MoP/SBA-15. In contrast, catalysts based on Fe and Co phosphides show a rather limited activity. Hydrocarbon distribution in the liquid product suggests that both hydrodeoxygenation and decarboxylation/decarbonylation reactions occur simultaneously over the different catalysts, although MoP/SBA-15 possess a selectivity towards hydrodeoxygenation exceeding 90%. Accordingly, the catalyst based on MoP affords the highest yield of n-octadecane, which is the preferred product in terms of carbon atom economy. Subsequently, in order to conjugate the advantages of both Ni and Mo phosphides, a series of catalysts containing variable proportions of both metals were prepared. The obtained results reveal that the mixed phosphides catalysts present a catalytic behavior intermediate between those of the monometallic phosphides. Accordingly, only marginal enhancement of the yield of n-octadecane is obtained for the catalysts with a Mo/Ni ratio of 3. Nevertheless, owing to this high selectivity for hydrodeoxygenation MoP/SBA-15 appears as a very promising catalyst for the production of advanced biofuels.

The leaching of potassium species in reused catalysts was observed, as verified by XRF (X-ray fluorescence). KI/γ-Al2O3 had a long life time and maintained sustained activity even after being repeatedly used for 11 cycles. The biodiesel yield was comparable to that produced from smaller catalysts.

Biofuel cells employ immobilized enzymes to convert the available chemical energy of organic fuels directly into electricity. However, biofuel cells are limited by short lifetime due to enzyme inactivation and frequent need to incorporate mediators to shuttle electrons to the final electron acceptor. In this context, other electrochemical power sources are necessary in energy conversion and storage device applications. Here we report on the fabrication and characterization of a membrane-free aluminium/phosphate cell based on the activation of aluminium (Al) using ZnO nanocrystal in an Al/phosphate cell as a 'green' alternative to the traditional enzymatic biofuel cells. The hybrid cell operates in neutral phosphate buffer solution and physiological saline buffer. The ZnO modifier in the phosphate rich electrolyte activated the pitting of Al resulting in the production of hydrogen, as the reducing agent for the reduction of H2PO4- ions to HPO32- ions at a formal potential of -0.250 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Specifically, the fabricated cell operating in phosphate buffer and physiological saline buffer exhibit an open-circuit voltage of 0.810 V and 0.751 V and delivered a maximum power density of 0.225 mW cm-2 and 1.77 mW cm-2, respectively. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of generating electricity by activating Al as anodic material in a hybrid cell supplied with phosphate rich electrolyte. Our approach simplifies the construction and operation of the electrochemical power source as a novel ""green"" alternative to the current anodic substrates used in enzymatic biofuel cells for low power bioelectronics applications. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, the selectivity is low for numerous catalysts due to the rapid formation of di-condensed by products. Herein, MIL-101-encapsulating phosphotungstic acid is synthesized to catalyze the self-condensation with selectivity of more than 95%. PTA clusters are uniformly dispersed in MOF cages and decrease the empty space (pore size), which provides both acidic sites and shape-selective capability. The optimal PTA amount decreases corresponding to the increase of reactant size. The shape-selectivity is also realized by changing the pore size of MOF such as from MIL-101 to MIL-100. Moreover, the catalyst is resistant to PTA leaching and performs stably after 5 runs. After hydrodeoxygenation of the mono-condensed product, high-density biofuels with densities of 0.867 g ml-1 and 0.887 g ml-1 were obtained from cyclopentanone and cyclohexanone, respectively. This study not only provides a promising route for the production of high-density biofuel but also suggests the advantage of MOF-based catalysts for shape-selective catalysis involving large molecular size. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84938516332

In the work, a novel heterogeneous base catalyst was prepared by anchoring 1,3-dicyclohexyl-2-octylguanidine (DCOD) onto the mesoporous SBA-15 silica. The DCOG-functionalized SBA-15 material (SBA-15-pr-DCOG) was demonstrated to be an efficient and recyclable heterogeneous catalyst for the transesterification of soybean oil with methanol. The characterization of the catalyst was carried out using Hammett titration method, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermo gravimetric and differential thermal analysis, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, nitrogen adsorption-desorption techniques. It was shown that the DCOD was successfully tethered on the SBA-15 silica and ordered mesoporous structure of SBA-15 was largely remained unchanged after the functionalization reaction. The influences of transesterification variables such as the methanol/oil molar ratio, catalyst loading, reaction time, and catalyst reusability on the oil conversion were investigated. By using the methanol/oil molar ratio of 15:1 and catalyst loading of 8wt.%, the maximum oil conversion of 92.6% was achieved over the solid catalyst at reflux of methanol for 15h.

However, there has been little study of the synergy of hybrid electrocatalytic systems. We report the preparation of hybrid bioanodes based on Au nanoparticles supported on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) co-immobilized with glucose oxidase (GOx). Mediated electron transfer was achieved by two strategies: ferrocene entrapped within polypyrrole and a ferrocene-modified linear poly(ethylenimine) (Fc-LPEI) redox polymer. Electrochemical characterization of the Au nanoparticles supported on MWCNTs indicate that this catalyst exhibits an electrocatalytic response for glucose even in acidic conditions. Using the redox polymer Fc-LPEI as the mediator, voltammetric and amperometric data demonstrated that these bioanodes can efficiently achieve mediated electron transfer and also indicated higher catalytic currents with the hybrid bioelectrode. From the amperometry, the maximum current density (Jmax) achieved with the hybrid bioelectrode was 615 ± 39 μA cm-2, whereas the bioanode employing GOx only achieved a Jmax of 409 ± 26 μA cm-2. Biofuel cell tests are consistent with the electrochemical characterization, thus confirming that the addition of the metallic species into the bioanode structure can improve fuel oxidation and consequently, improve the power generated by the system. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Agricultural wastes are available and renewable energy resources to supply energy demand of the future. The purpose of this study is to investigate the production of hydrogen-rich syngas from wheat straw, walnut shell, and almond shell. Methods: Supercritical water gasification is a promising technology to convert biomass into useful fuels. Non-catalytic conversion of wheat straw, walnut shell, and almond shell into the hydrogen-rich gas in supercritical water media was performed using homemade batch microreactor system. Results: Hydrogen gas yields of 6.52, 4.26 and 4.1 mmol per 1 gram of wheat straw, walnut shell, and almond shell were observed, respectively. In addition, hydrogen and carbon gasification efficiencies equal to 42.6 and 46.9 % were calculated from gaseous products and elemental analysis of wheat straw, which were higher than other feedstocks’ gasification efficiencies. Conclusion: Wheat straw had the highest and walnut shell had the lowest total gas and hydrogen gas yields. Taking into account the structural analysis, it was recognized that feedstocks with higher cellulose and hemicellulose and lower lignin contents were better gasified due to their easier hydrolysis and higher solubility in water. © 2015, The Author(s).","Biomass; Gasification; Hydrogen production; Supercritical water media","Juglans; Prunus dulcis; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84931023911

Methanol showed a wider equivalence ratio (Φ) range of stable combustion, lower conversion rates, higher CO2 selectivity and higher energy release efficiencies compared to ethanol. As Φ increased from 0.8 to 1.4, the relative conversion rate of methanol increased whereas that of ethanol decreased.

Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is the main chemical process to remove oxygen-containing functionalities. Here, we have reported the HDO of phenols in a biphasic H2O/n-dodecane system. A series of supported Ru catalysts were prepared, characterized and explored for the reaction among which Ru/CNT showed the highest catalytic activity towards the production of alkanes. The model reaction with eugenol achieved a high conversion (&gt;99%) and a high alkane selectivity (98%), which was much higher than the results from the monophasic system (56.5% yield of alkanes in H2O). The reaction conditions including reaction temperature, hydrogen pressure and the ratio of H2O/n-C12H26 were optimized. The kinetic experiments revealed that eugenol was first hydrogenated to 4-propyl-guaiacol, and then deoxygenated into 4-propyl-cyclohexanol which was the main detected intermediate of the reaction.

NBCs are fabricated by immobilizing enzymes with functional nanomaterials as enzyme carriers or containers. In this paper, we review the recent developments of novel nanocarriers/nanocontainers with advanced hierarchical porous structures for retaining enzymes, such as nanofibres (NFs), mesoporous nanocarriers and nanocages. Strategies for immobilizing enzymes onto nanocarriers made from polymers, silicas, carbons and metals by physical adsorption, covalent binding, cross-linking or specific ligand spacers are discussed. The resulting NBCs are critically evaluated in terms of their bioprocessing performances. Excellent performances are demonstrated through enhanced NBC catalytic activity and stability due to conformational changes upon immobilization and localized nanoenvironments, and NBC reutilization by assembling magnetic nanoparticles into NBCs to defray the high operational costs associated with enzyme production and nanocarrier synthesis. We also highlight several challenges associated with the NBC-driven bioprocess applications, including the maturation of large-scale nanocarrier synthesis, design and development of bioreactors to accommodate NBCs, and long-term operations of NBCs. We suggest these challenges are to be addressed through joint collaboration of chemists, engineers and material scientists. Finally, we have demonstrated the great potential of NBCs in manufacturing bioprocesses in the near future through successful laboratory trials of NBCs in carbohydrate hydrolysis, biofuel production and biotransformation. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Polluting emission from the fossil fuel also increases as the vehicle density and population rises. Vegetable oil promises better abilities to be an alternative for conventional fuel and polluting emission. Most of the vegetable oil is extracted from their seeds and are subjected to transesterification to be used in internal combustion engine as biofuel. In this article, cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL) extracted from cashew nut shell has been selected and tested for its physical and chemical properties. The major constituent of CNSL oil obtained by the pyrolysis process is cardanol. Physical properties of this oil are in the acceptable range for the selection of biomass as an alternative fuel and are very closer to the vegetable oil. Chemical structure of this oil shows that the absence of triglycerides and hence transesterification process is not required. Different blends can be prepared by simply mixing it in diesel and tested for its physical and chemical properties. Based on the test results, biodiesel blend is optimized for its suitability to be used in compression ignition engine as an alternative biofuel. © 2015 Journal of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences.","Biodiesel; Cardanol; Properties; Transesterification; Vegetable oil","biofuel; cardanol oil; cashew nut shell liquid oil; copper; oil; sulfur; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; vegetable oil; Article; biomass production; calorific value; cashew nut; chemical parameters; chemical structure; compression; corrosion; density; molecular weight; physical chemistry; physical parameters; pyrolysis; transesterification; viscosity; Anacardium occidentale",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939440576

The bioanode architectures were designed with both direct electron transfer (DET) and mediated electron transfer (MET) mechanisms employing high surface area materials such as multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and MWCNT-decorated gold nanoparticles, along with different immobilization techniques. Three different polymeric matrices were tested (tetrabutyl ammonium bromide (TBAB)-modified Nafion; octyl-modified linear polyethyleneimine (C8-LPEI); and cellulose) in the DET studies. The modified Nafion membrane provided the best electrical communication between enzymes and the electrode surface, with catalytic currents as high as 16.8±2.1μAcm-2. Then, a series of ferrocene redox polymers were evaluated for MET. The redox polymer 1,1'-dimethylferrocene-modified linear polyethyleneimine (FcMe2-C3-LPEI) provided the best electrochemical response. Using this polymer, the electrochemical assays conducted in the presence of MWCNTs and MWCNTs-Au indicated a Jmax of 781±59μAcm-2 and 925±68μAcm-2, respectively. Overall, from the results obtained here, DET using the PQQ-dependent ADH and AldDH still lacks high current density, while the bioanodes that operate via MET employing ferrocene-modified LPEI redox polymers show efficient energy conversion capability in ethanol/air biofuel cells. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Alcoholic biofuel cell; Direct electron transfer; Ferrocene mediators; PQQ-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase; PQQ-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase","Aldehydes; Biofuels; Biological fuel cells; Electrodes; Electron emission; Electron transitions; Enzyme electrodes; Enzymes; Ethanol; Organometallics; Polymer membrane electrodes; Polymers; Yarn; Alcohol dehydrogenase; Aldehyde dehydrogenase; Direct electron transfer; Electrochemical response; Ferrocenes; Linear polyethyleneimine; Mediated electron transfer; Tetrabutyl ammonium bromides; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN); alcohol; aldehyde dehydrogenase; biofuel; carbon nanotube; gold nanoparticle; multi walled nanotube; pyrroloquinolinequinone; 1,1'-dimethylferrocene; alcohol; alcohol dehydrogenase; aldehyde dehydrogenase; ferrous ion; fluorocarbon; immobilized enzyme; perfluorosulfonic acid; polyethyleneimine; pyrroloquinolinequinone; Article; catalysis; electrochemical analysis; electrode; electron transport; energy conversion; enzyme active site; enzyme kinetics; enzyme structure; hydrogel; hydrophilicity; hydrophobicity; oxidation; pH; surface property; bioenergy; chemical structure; chemistry; electrode; enzymology; Gluconobacter; isolation and purification; metabolism; microbiology; oxidation reduction reaction; Alcohol Dehydrogenase; Aldehyde Dehydrogenase; Bioelectric Energy Sources; Electrodes; Electron Transport; Enzymes, Immobilized; Ethanol; Ferrous Compounds; Fluorocarbon Polymers; Gluconobacter; Models, Molecular; Nanotubes, Carbon; Oxidation-Reduction; Polyethyleneimine; PQQ Cofactor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84929304506

The catalyst was obtained by calcination of a mixture of KF and γ-Al2O3 (mKF/mγ-Al2O3 = 70%) at 500°C for 3 h. Nano-solid-base catalyst was characterized with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), thermal gravimetry (TG) and the Hammett indicator methods. The TEM image depicted nanoparticles and uniform dispersion of active phase over alumina. The XRD analysis confirmed the formation of potassium aluminum fluoride (K3AlF6) and potassium oxide, active catalyst for transesterification. The transesterification of soybean oil with methanol was performed by using both low frequency ultrasonic reactor (20 kHz) and mechanical stirring in the presence of KF/γ-Al2O3. The influence of various parameters such as ultrasonic power, oil/methanol molar ratio, catalyst concentration, time, and temperature were studied on the biodiesel formation. The maximum yield (95%) was achieved by applying 45W acoustic power, molar ratio of alcohol to oil at 12:1, catalyst concentration of 2.0 wt%, 40 min sonication, and temperature of 50°C. The transesterification was performed in 360 min using mechanical stirring with 76% yield.

We describe four different synthesis protocols: microwave-assisted heating, water-in-oil, and dendrimer-encapsulated nanoparticles using acid or thiol species in the extraction step. The physical characterization of the metallic nanoparticles indicated that both the synthetic protocol as well as the type of functional groups on the carbon nanotubes affect the final particle size (varying from 13.4 to 2.4 nm) and their distribution onto the carbon surface. Moreover, the electrochemical data indicated that these two factors also influence their performance toward the electrooxidation of NADH. We observed that the samples containing Au nanoparticles with smaller size leads to higher catalytic currents and also shifts the oxidation potential of the targeted reaction, which varied from 0.13 to -0.06 V vs Ag/AgCl.

The acid-base catalyst comprising CaO and La2O3 mixed metal oxides with various Ca/La atomic ratios were synthesized via co-precipitation method. The effects of Ca/La compositions on the surface area, acidity-basicity and transesterification activity were investigated. Integrated metal-metal oxide between Ca and La enhanced the catalytic activity due to well dispersion of CaO on composite surface and thus, increased the surface acidic and basic sites as compared to that of bulk CaO and La2O3 metal oxide. Furthermore, the transesterification reactions resulted that the catalytic activity of CaO-La2O3 series were increased with Ca/La atomic ratio to 8.0, but the stability of binary system decreased by highly saturated of CaO on the catalyst surface at Ca/La atomic ratio of 10.0. The highest biodiesel yield (98.76%) was achieved under transesterification condition of 160°C, 3h, 25 methanol/oil molar ratio and 3wt.%. In addition, the stability of CaO-La2O3 binary system was studied. In this study, Ca-La binary system is stable even after four cycles with negligible leaching of Ca2+ ion in the reaction medium. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Acid-base catalyst; Biodiesel; Co-precipitation; Heterogeneous catalyst; Jatropha oil; Transesterification","Atoms; Calcium; Catalyst activity; Metallic compounds; Systems (metallurgical); Transesterification; Transesterification; Acid-base catalysts; Biodiesel production; Coprecipitation method; Heterogeneous catalyst; High free fatty acids; Jatropha oil; Transesterification activity; Transesterification reaction; Acid base; Biodiesel; Biodiesel; biofuel; catalyst; ester; evergreen tree; fatty acid; oxide; precipitation (chemistry); catalysis; plant community; reaction kinetics; temperature effect; Jatropha",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906509959

At the anode, ethanol was oxidized by alcohol dehydrogenase, whereas at the cathode, the oxygen was reduced by laccase. Fuel and oxidant streams moved in parallel laminar flow without turbulent mixing into a microchannel fabricated using soft lithography methods. The enzymes were immobilized in the presence of reactive species at gold electrode surfaces. Bioelectrocatalytic processes were enhanced by combination of enzymes and carbon nanoparticles, attributed to appropriate electron transport and high amount enzyme loading. The benefit of the nanoparticles with higher surface porosity was explained by the high porous structure that offered a closer proximity to the reactive species and improved diffusion of the substrates within the enzyme films. The microfluidic BFC was optimized as function of electrode patterns, showing that higher current and power densities were achieved for shorter and wider electrodes that allow for thinner boundary layer depletion at the electrodes surface resulting in efficient catalytic consumption of fuel and oxidant.

Therefore, it is necessary to seek green, environmentally friendly, and renewable energy candidates, for which biodiesel fuel has been developed as a promising candidate for energy accommodation. Currently, the most applied approach for the production of biodiesel involves the esterification and/or transesterification reaction. Among various catalytic processes, heterogeneous catalysts are promising and receiving increasing attention due to the easy separation of products and catalysts as well as the high-purity glycerine (glycerol) byproduct that avoids significant waste emissions and effectively reduces the environmental pollution.

The catalytic nanoparticles of various compositions, AuxPty, deposited on carbon black (CB) were prepared and extensively characterized to select the species with selectivity for glucose oxidation and oxygen reduction. Then two kinds of 3D-electrode materials with different morphology, buckypaper composed of carbon nanotubes (ca. 50nm diameter) and carbon paper made of carbon fibers (ca. 7μm diameter), were used in a combination with different catalytic species.

In the present research work, the seed oil of Momordica charantia (M. charantia) was for the first time appraised as possible nonedible oil for synthesis of biodiesel. M. charantia has oil content (36.10 ± 4.20%), high acid value (1.82 mg KOH g-1), and its oil enable base-catalyzed transesterified for biodiesel production after acid pretreatment. It was transesterified under standard conditions at 6:1 molar ratio of methanol to oil; sodium methoxide (1.00 wt.% in relation to oil mass) as a catalyst; 60°C reaction temperature and 90 min of reaction time. At optimum conditions biodiesel yield of 93.2% was acquired. The reaction followed first order kinetics. The activation energy (E A) was 254.5 kcal mol-1 and the rate constant value was 1.30 × 10-4 min-1 at 60°C. Gas chromatography investigation of M. charantia seed oil methyl esters (MSOMEs) depicted that the fatty acid composition comprises a high proportion of mono-unsaturated fatty acids (64.11 ± 5.02%). MSOMEs were also characterized using Fourier Transform Infrared and 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy. The tested fuel properties of the MSOMEs, except oxidative stability, were conformed to EN 14214 and ASTM D6751 standards. The low-value oxidative stability of MSOMEs can be solved by adding antioxidants additives. In summary, M. charantia oil has potential as nonedible raw material for biodiesel production. © 2014 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","1H-NMR; FT-IR; Fuel properties; GC; Kinetic study; Methanolysis; Momordica charantia seed oil","1H-NMR; FT-IR; Fuel properties; GC; Kinetic study; Methanolysis; Seed oil; Activation energy; Additives; Esterification; Esters; Fuels; Gas chromatography; Kinetic theory; Kinetics; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Oils and fats; Oxidation resistance; Rate constants; Unsaturated fatty acids; Biodiesel; biofuel; canola; experimental study; FTIR spectroscopy; fuel consumption; gas chromatography; vegetable oil; Momordica charantia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892709252

Comparison with the parent CuO/SiO 2 material, which was already shown to exhibit Lewis acid sites due to the high dispersion of the CuO phase, provided evidence that reduction of this phase to the metallic state increases the acidity of the material. This allowed us to set up a bifunctional catalyst showing acidic and hydrogenation activity, both ascribable to the presence of the metal particle, without the need of an acidic support. This catalyst was tested in the one-pot transformation of γ-valerolactone into pentyl valerate and showed comparable activity (91% vs 92% conversion) and improved selectivity (92% vs 72%) with respect to the previously reported copper catalyst supported on acidic material.

We describe two different methodologies for the preparation of the bioanodes: in a first case, multi walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were employed as a support for the metallic nanoparticles and TBAB-modified Nafion® aided enzyme immobilization. In the second case, we immobilized the enzymes using dendrimers-encapsulated nanoparticles as the agent for enzyme anchoring. The biofuel cell tests showed that the addition of metallic nanoparticles to the bioanode structure enhanced the overall biofuel cell performance. The bioelectrode containing Au nanoparticles displaying the best performance, with an open circuit potential of 0.61 ± 0.05 V and a maximum power density of 155 ± 11 μW cm-2. NADH cyclic voltammetric experiments indicated that Au nanoparticles behaved as a catalyst toward NADH oxidation. Comparing the two protocols we used to synthetized nanoparticles, the sample containing the Au nanoparticles supported on MWCNTs furnished fourfold higher values.

The oxygen-containing groups in mono- and binuclear phenols were removed through a cleavage of C-O bonds in phenolics followed by an integrated metal- and acid-catalyzed hydrogenation and dehydration. As a bifunctional catalyst Ru/HZSM-5, the presence of both the Brønsted acid site in the pores of HZSM-5 for dehydration and a metallic function of Ru for hydrogenation was indispensible for the formation of alkanes from lignin-derived phenolics. Our findings also reveal that the Ru/HZSM-5 with the lowest Si/Al ratio of HZSM-5 proved to be most selective to cycloalkanes, indicating that more acid sites over zeolite are favorable for the dehydration of cyclohexanol during hydrodeoxygenation process, which leads higher selectivity to hydrocarbons.

Among the many renewable fuels currently available around the world, biodiesel offers an immediate impact in our energy. In fact, a huge interest in related research indicates a promising future for the biodiesel technology. Heterogeneous catalyzed production of biodiesel has emerged as a preferred route as it is environmentally benign needs no water washing and product separation is much easier. The number of well-defined catalyst complexes that are able to catalyze transesterification reactions efficiently has been significantly expanded in recent years. The activity of catalysts, specifically in application to solid acid/base catalyst in transesterification reaction depends on their structure, strength of basicity/acidity, surface area as well as the stability of catalyst. There are various process intensification technologies based on the use of alternate energy sources such as ultrasound and microwave. The latest advances in research and development related to biodiesel production is represented by non-catalytic supercritical method and focussed exclusively on these processes as forthcoming transesterification processes. The latest developments in this field featuring highly active catalyst complexes are outlined in this review. The knowledge of more extensive research on advances in biofuels will allow a deeper insight into the mechanism of these technologies toward meeting the critical energy challenges in future. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Upon screening the catalytic performance of modified TiO2 doped with different K-compounds, 0.7 C 4H4O6HK doped on TiO2 was selected. The preparation of the catalyst was done using incipient wetness impregnation method. Having doped modified TiO2 with C4H 4O6HK, followed by impregnation, drying and calcination at 600 °C for 6 h, the catalyst was characterized by XRD, FTIR, SEM, BET, TGA, UV and the Hammett indicators. The yield of the biodiesel was proportional to the catalyst basicity. The catalyst had granular and porous structures with high basicity and superior performance. Combined conditions of 16:1 molar ratio of methanol to oil, 5 wt.% catalyst amount, 60 °C reaction temperature and 30 min reaction time was enough for maximum yield of 90.1%. The catalyst maintained sustained activity after five cycles of use. The oxidative stability which was the main problem of the biodiesel was improved from 2.0 h to 3.2 h after 30 days using ascorbic acid as antioxidant. The other properties including the flash point, cetane number and the cold flow ones were however, comparable to international standards. The study indicated that Ti-0.7-600-6 is an efficient, economical and environmentally, friendly catalyst under ultrasonication for producing biodiesel from S. marianum oil with a substantial yield. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The conversion of cellulose or cellobiose into sorbitol was used as an application reaction to investigate their catalytic performance. Various metal nanocatalysts loaded on RGO were compared and RGO-supported Pt exhibited the highest catalytic activity with 91.5 % of sorbitol yield from cellobiose. The catalytic performances of Pt nanocatalysts supported on different carbon materials or on silica support were also compared. The results showed that RGO was the best catalyst support, and the yield of sorbitol was as high as 91.5 % from cellobiose and 58.9 % from cellulose, respectively. The improvement of catalytic activity was attributed to the appropriate Pt particle size and hydrogen spillover effect of Pt/RGO catalyst. Interestingly, the size and dispersion of supported Pt particles could be easily regulated by convenient adjustment of the microwave heating temperature. The catalytic performance was found to initially increase and then decrease with increasing particle size. The optimum Pt particle size was 3.6 nm. These findings may offer useful guidelines for designing novel catalysts with beneficial catalytic performance for biomass conversion.

It was found that the catalyst containing yBa-xSr/ZSM-5 (where x=6wt.% strontium based on ZSM-5 weight and y=4wt.% barium based on the strontium weight) is an optimal catalyst for biodiesel production. The results showed that the best operational conditions are the methanol/oil=9/1 at 60°C with mechanical stirring of 500rpm for 180min. The maximum biodiesel FAME yield of 87.7% was achieved by using the optimal catalyst. Characterization of the catalyst sample was performed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and N2 adsorption-desorption measurement methods. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Biodiesel; Calcination conditions; Characterization; Operational condition; Optimal catalyst","Biodiesel; Calcination; Characterization; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Optimization; Scanning electron microscopy; Strontium; X ray diffraction; Adsorption-desorption measurements; Biodiesel production; Calcination conditions; Fatty acids methyl esters; Incipient wetness impregnation method; Operational conditions; Optimal catalysts; Reaction temperature; Catalysts; barium; biofuel; catalyst; FTIR spectroscopy; scanning electron microscopy; strontium; X-ray diffraction; zeolite",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900317427

The synthesis has been carried out in two stages, viz. esterification and trans-esterification. The esterification process is not influenced by ultrasound. The transesterification process, however, shows marked enhancement with ultrasound. A statistical experimental design has been used to optimize the process conditions for the synthesis. XRD analysis confirms formation of Ca(OMe)2, which is the active catalyst for transesterification reaction. The optimum values of parameters for the highest yield of transesterification have been determined as follows: alcohol to oil molar ratio ≈ 11, catalyst concentration ≈ 5.5 wt.%, and temperature ≈ 64 C. The activation energy of the reaction is calculated as 133.5 kJ/mol. The heterogeneity of the system increases mass transfer constraints resulting in approx. 4× increase in activation energy as compared to homogeneous alkali catalyzed system. It is also revealed that intense micro-convection induced by ultrasound enhances the mass transfer characteristics of the system with ∼20% reduction in activation energy, as compared to mechanically agitated systems. Influence of catalyst concentration and alcohol to oil molar ratio on the transesterification yield is inter-linked through formation of methoxy ions and their diffusion to the oil-alcohol interface, which in turn is determined by the volume fractions of the two phases in the reaction mixture. As a result, the highest transesterification yield is obtained at the moderate values of catalyst concentration and alcohol to oil molar ratio. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This green electro-biorefining process does not require complex steps to separate levulinic acid and formic acid (FA) from H2SO4; instead it couples electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) of levulinic acid (LA) in a single electrocatalytic flow cell reactor and electrocatalytic oxidation of formic acid in a proton exchange membrane-direct formic acid fuel cell (DFAFC). The presence of FA has shown no negative effect on the ECH of LA and a high VA selectivity of &gt;90% can be achieved on a non-precious Pb electrode while the Faradaic efficiency remains &gt;47% during 8 hours of reaction in the single electrocatalytic flow cell reactor. This stream is fed directly to the DFAFC with a Pd/C anode catalyst to self-sustainably remove FA where 47% conversion of FA can be reached in 6 hours. However, electro-oxidation of FA over Pd/C appears to be reversibly inhibited by the product VA produced during ECH of LA. The electro-oxidation of FA + C2-C5 alkyl carboxylic acid in the half cell study shows that such an inhibition effect could have originated from the -COOH adsorption on the Pd surface. Higher carboxylic acid concentration and longer carbon chain lead to more serious loss of the electrocatalytic surface area (ECSA) of Pd/C. © 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894634394

Heterogeneous (or solid) catalysts for biodiesel synthesis have merit that they do not contaminate the byproduct of glycerol. In this paper, we have attempted to identify the mechanistic features of ultrasound-enhanced biodiesel synthesis with the base-catalyst of CaO. A statistical design of experiments (Box-Behnken) was used to identify the influence of temperature, alcohol to oil molar ratio and catalyst loading on transesterification yield. The optimum values of these parameters for the highest yield were identified through Response Surface Method (with a quadratic model) and ANOVA. These values are: temperature = 62 C, molar ratio = 10:1 and catalyst loading = 6 wt.%. The activation energy was determined as 82.3 kJ/mol, which is higher than that for homogeneous catalyzed system (for both acidic and basic catalyst). The experimental results have been analyzed vis-à-vis simulations of cavitation bubble dynamics. Due to 3-phase heterogeneity of the system, the yield was dominated by intrinsic kinetics, and the optimum temperature for the highest yield was close to boiling point of methanol. At this temperature, the influence of cavitation bubbles (in terms of both sonochemical and sonophysical effect) is negligible, and ultrasonic micro-streaming provided necessary convection in the system. The influence of all parameters on the reaction system was found to be strongly inter-dependent. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Box 6714967346, Kermanshah, Iran","The kinetic of the transesterification reaction over the C s X H 3 -X PW12O40/Fe-SiO2 catalyst prepared using sol-gel and impregnation procedures was investigated in different operational conditions. Experimental conditions were varied as follows: reaction temperature 323-333 K, methanol/oil molar ratio = 12/1, and the reaction time 0-240 min. The H3PW12O40 heteropolyacid has recently attracted significant attention due to its potential for application in the production of biodiesel, in either homogeneous or heterogeneous catalytic conditions. Although fatty acids esterification reaction has been known for some time, data is still scarce regarding kinetic and thermodynamic parameters, especially when catalyzed by nonconventional compounds such as H 3PW12O40. Herein, a kinetic study utilizing Gc-Mas in situ allows for evaluating the effects of operation conditions on reaction rate and determining the activation energy along with thermodynamic constants including Δ G, Δ S, and Δ H. It indicated that the C s X H 3 -X PW12O40/Fe-SiO2 magnetic nanocatalyst can be easily recycled with a little loss by magnetic field and can maintain higher catalytic activity and higher recovery even after being used 5 times. Characterization of catalyst was carried out by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), N2 adsorption-desorption measurements methods, thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). © 2013 Mostafa Feyzi et al.",,"biofuel; cesium; metal nanoparticle; methanol; article; catalysis; chemical model; chemistry; computer simulation; kinetics; Biofuels; Catalysis; Cesium; Computer Simulation; Kinetics; Metal Nanoparticles; Methanol; Models, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893836113

Food waste valorization is one of the current research areas that has attracted a great deal of attention over the past few years as a potential alternative to the disposal of a wide range of residues in landfill sites. In particular, the development of environmentally sound and innovative strategies to process such waste is an area of increasing importance in our current society. Landfill, incineration and composting are common, mature technologies for waste disposal. However, they are not satisfactory to treating organic waste due to the generation of toxic methane gas and bad odor, high energy consumption and slow reaction kinetics. In fact, research efforts have also been oriented on novel technologies to decompose organic waste. However, no valuable product is generated from the decomposition process. Instead of disposing and decomposing food waste, recent research has focused on its utilization as energy source (e.g., for bioethanol and biodiesel production). Organic waste is also useful to generate useful organic chemicals via biorefinery or white biotechnology (e.g., succinic acid and/or bio-plastics). This article is aimed to summarize recent development of waste valorization strategies for the sustainable production of chemicals, materials, and fuels through the development of green production strategies. It will also provide key insights into recent legislation on management of waste worldwide as well as two relevant case studies (the transformation of corncob residues into functionalized biomass-derived carbonaceous solid acids and their utilization in the production of biodiesel-like biofuels from waste oils in Philippines, as well as the development of a bakery waste based biorefinery for succinic acid and bioplastic production in Hong Kong) to illustrate the enormous potential of biowaste valorization for a more sustainable society. Future research directions and possible sustainable approaches will also be discussed with their respective proofs of concept. © 2013 The Authors.","Biowaste; Chemicals; Energy; Food waste; Green chemistry; Materials; Waste valorization","Biodiesel; Bioethanol; Chemical contamination; Chemicals; Decomposition; Energy utilization; Incineration; Land fill; Laws and legislation; Materials; Oils and fats; Organic chemicals; Planning; Reaction kinetics; Refining; Sustainable development; Waste disposal; Waste management; Wastes; Bio-waste; Energy; Food waste; Green chemistry; Waste valorizations; Waste incineration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892673258

While there have been previous reports that ketonization reactions are sensitive to the surface morphology of the respective catalyst, these studies have largely been performed in idealized conditions. Here, shape selective ceria nanocatalysts were synthesized and examined in both condensed and vapor phase ketonization reactions with the model bio-oil compound, acetic acid. It was found that in lower temperature (503 K) condensed-phase conditions the morphology of the catalyst was of less importance due to crystal disruption from metal carboxylate formation. However, the bulk structure was maintained to a greater extent in the higher temperature (623 K) vapor phase conditions.

Among the solutions is the development of technologies and infrastructures to help in the smooth transition to alternative and renewable energy sources. Nanotechnology, a combination of chemistry and engineering, is viewed as the new candidate for clean energy applications. It involves the manipulation of nanoscale structures to integrate them into larger material components and systems. In comparison to bulk materials, nanomaterials have high surface areas and are expected to exhibit higher activities. They also demonstrate better stability and durability and are more cost-effective with high recycling potential. This paper reviews selected recent advances in the development of nanotechnology in the emerging solar energy and biofuel fields. Special emphases are given to studies on photovoltaics (including Schottky junction solar cells, organic solar cells, quantum dot-sensitized solar cells, and earth-abundant Cu2ZnSnS4 materials) and artificial photosynthesis. As for the biofuel section, a review on the use of nanotechnology in transesterification, gasification, pyrolysis, and hydrogenation, as well as in the reforming of biomass-derived compounds is given.

The base strength of the catalysts was tested by the Hammett indicator method, and the results showed that the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) yield was related to their total basicity. The catalyst was also characterized by FTIR, TGA, XRD and TEM. The experimental results showed that a 2.0:1 volume ratio of methanol to oil, 65°C reaction temperature, 30min reaction time and 10wt.% catalyst amount gave the highest the yield of biodiesel.

Tetraethyl-orthosilicate (TEOS) and iron nitrate (Fe(NO3)3) were used as the precursors for the silica and iron phases, respectively. Thermal treatments of as-spun precursor fibers were applied to generate nanocrystals of iron with various oxidation states (pure iron and hematite). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to probe the fiber morphology and crystal structures. The results indicated that the size, phase, and placement of iron nanocrystals can be tuned by varying the precursor concentration, thermal treatment conditions, and processing scheme. The resulting nanofiber/metal systems obtained via both monoaxial and coaxial electrospinning were applied as catalysts to the alkaline hydrolysis of glucose for the production of fuel gas.

The product gas is composed of mostly H2 (&gt;96mol%) and CH4 with very low concentrations of CO2 and CO. Due to the clear separation of reaction temperature for H2 and CH4 production, pure hydrogen can be obtained at low reaction temperatures.

Heterogeneous transesterification is considered to be a green process. The process requires neither catalyst recovery nor aqueous treatment steps and very high yields of methyl esters can be obtained, close to the theoretical value. However, heterogeneously catalyzed transesterification generally requires more severe operating conditions, and the performance of heterogeneous catalysts is generally lower than that of the commonly used homogeneous catalysts. Heterogeneous catalysis for biodiesel production has been extensively investigated in the last few years. Many metal oxides have been studied for the transesterification process of oils; these include alkali earth metal oxides, transition metal oxides, mixed metal oxides and supported metal oxides. The use of solid metal oxides as catalysts in oil transesterification is well established, accordingly, researchers' attempts are now focused on how to attain the highest catalyst activity. Catalyst activity is a function of its specific surface area, base strength and base site concentration. High specific surface area, strong base strength and high concentration of base sites are characteristics of an active transesterification catalyst. This review provides a brief overview of the different metal oxides frequently used in the process of transesterification of oils for the production of biodiesel with special reference to the various methods of catalyst preparation and catalyst characterization. Reaction conditions and catalyst leaching analysis are also highlighted. Finally, concluding remarks regarding catalyst selection and catalyst preparation steps are provided. © IRSEN, CEERS,IAU.","Catalyst characterization; Catalyst preparation; Catalyst selection; Heterogeneous catalysis; Leaching; Transesterification","biofuel; catalysis; catalyst; ester; heterogeneity; metal; oil production; optimization; renewable resource",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78651487257

Research projects have aimed at improving power supply lifetime for longevity of an implanted sensor system. Miniature power sources, inspired from the biofuel cell principle, can utilize enzymes (proteins) as catalysts to produce energy from fuel(s) that are perennial in the human body. Bio-nanocatalytic hierarchical structures, clusters made of enzyme molecules, can be covalently linked to the electrode's surface to provide better enzyme loading and sustained activity. Carbon nanotube base electrodes, with high surface area for direct electron transfer, and enzyme clusters can achieve efficient enzymatic redox reaction. A redox pair of such bioelectrodes can make up a power source with improved performance. In this study, we have investigated high throughput processes for coupling enzyme catalysts with power harvesting mechanisms via a screen printing process and solution processing. The process incorporates enzyme (glucosse oxidase and catalase) micro-/nanocluster immobilization on the surface of carboxylated (functionalized) carbon nanotubes with screen printed electrodes. The 1-ethyl-3-(3- dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide and N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide amide linkage chemistries were used to bind the enzyme molecules to nanotube surface, and bis[sulfosuccinimidyl] suberate (BS3) was used as the cross-linker between enzymes. Optimized enzyme cross-linking was obtained after 25 min at room temperature with 0.07 mmol BS3/nmol of enzymes, with which 44% of enzymes were immobilized onto the surface of the bioelectrode with only 24% enzyme activity lost. A cell, redox pair of bioelectrodes, was tested under continuous operation. It was able to maintain most of the enzyme activity for 7 days before complete deactivation at 16 days. Thus, the power harvesting mechanism was able to produce power continuously for 7 days. The results were also analyzed to identify impeding factors such as competitive inhibition by reaction byproduct and cathode design, and methods to rectify them have been discussed. Coupling this new and improved nanobiopower cell with a product removal mechanism and enzyme mutagenesis should provide enzyme protection and longevity. This would bring the research one step closer to development of compatible implantable battery technology for medical applications. © 2010 by ASME.","Bionanocatalysis; Catalase; Enzyme clusters; Glucose oxidase; Printed electronics; Sensor power source; Stable bioelectrode","Bionanocatalysis; Catalase; Printed electronics; Sensor power source; Stable bioelectrode; Amides; Carbon nanotubes; Catalysts; Electrodes; Enzyme immobilization; Enzymes; Glucose; Glucose oxidase; Glucose sensors; Medical applications; Printing presses; Redox reactions; Research; Sensors; Enzyme activity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78649972124

Knowledge-based systematic approaches are mandatory to arrive at scalable and sustainable solutions. Chemistry for energy, ""ENERCHEM"" contributes in many ways already today to the use of fossil energy carriers. Optimization of these processes exemplified by catalysis for fuels and chemicals production or by solid-state lightning can contribute in the near future substantially to the dual challenge of energy use and climate protection being in fact two sides of the same challenge.

The particle was used as the anode catalyst of a prototype hybrid biofuel cell, which operated on glucose and hydrogen peroxide. The output power of the hybrid cell showed a dependence on the enzymes used as the cathode catalyst. The power density was optimized to 3.7 μW/cm2 when horseradish peroxidase was replaced by microperoxidase-11 (MP-11). Comparing the output power of the hybrid cell to that of a biofuel cell indicates enhanced cell performance due to the fast reaction kinetics of the particle.

The structure, acid properties, and catalytic activity of the nanotubes as heterogeneous catalysts for biodiesel production were then studied in detail. The ZnPW nanocatalyst exhibited higher catalytic activities for the simultaneous esterification and transesterification of palmitic acid than the parent acid catalyst 12-tungstophosphoric acid (H3PW12O40). Moreover, the doubly acidic nanotubes led to markedly enhanced yields of methyl esters in the conversion of waste cooking oil (containing 26.89 wt% free fatty acids and 1 % moisture) to biodiesel. The catalyst could be recycled and reused with negligible loss in activity over five cycles. The ZnPW nanocatalyst is acid- and water-tolerant and is an environmentally benign heterogeneous catalyst for the production of biodiesel from low-quality feedstocks. © 2009 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.
